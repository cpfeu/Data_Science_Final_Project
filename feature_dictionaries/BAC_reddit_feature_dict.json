is to park funds in uvxy a leveraged vix instrument i do not recommend this generally absent a strategy and a tolerance for huge and quick losses but in the event of sudden marketwide corrections the leveraged holding will spike dramatically and provide some hopefully extra source of funds at the exact moment that stock prices have pulled back there is a bit of calculus and intuition to it as

now but imo these are the most amazon proof retailers out there couple that with the ever growing suburban population and these companies are looking good healthcare a lot of good options here and a lot of bad ones stick to the blue chips in this sector i personally have mrk and unh but any of unh s competitors are solid as well particularly antm jnj lly amgn abbv all look good right now they did have a huge run up last week so maybe excercise some patience another lesser known company but i opened a decent position in vrtx it has a beautiful balance sheet and was recently gapped down the ultimate value play oil i think rds and psx are best poised to make a comeback sometime in the next year or two industrials the a amp d sector is attractively valued right now ba and rtx definitely

running corr of those stocks vs apple and tesla and showing tesla is as and maybe more diversifying do not let anyone tell you you are not a savant longer analysis below on vanilla first principles your prof is right in that apple is growth different industry vs those value stocks in banking and automotive however i think you could argue that 1 tesla like apple is a growth stock but unlike apple it is not in any of the indices ford and gm and bac are in and just from that has independent movement it also does move independently 2 you could further argue that while it is technically auto industry it is also green tech and those dominate its historical movements and that auto is a questionable sector assignment to it on this basis 3 it is just as economically sensitive as apple 4 lastly apple is nearing max size it can be while tesla has theoretical max growth ahead making it much more a growth stock in summary it is not obvious that tesla has less diversification potential so this is really a coin flip i ran a correlation calc to check the real world truth since it appears diversification is not a goal both apple and tesla have a 91 corr with each other but a 3 with gm over a 4 year period they are both highly diversifying but bac has more correlation with apple than tesla ford is negatively correlated with both apple and tesla but less correlated with apple slightly in other words empirically tesla and apple greatly diversify you and are together highly correlated but tesla may diversify you slightly more depending on the allocations of the starting

is this when the market drops big often times it is hard to look at your account it is frustrating and you almost want to ignore it or forget about it like a bad grade relationship bill or anything

to sell those even though there is much better places for your money one of the examples i will give you is from me personally this year i had 25 my account in back this is a preferred callable stock that trades around 25 and pays 7 dividend payment when the market crashed this crashed too it dropped to 20 a 20 drop and i was pissed because it should not have moved that much because i knew bac was capable of making the dividend payment and they had to pay me before their common shareholders as much as i did not want to sell this stock knowing it would recover back to 25 pretty easily i had to force myself to realize that there were other stocks out there that lost much more and long term were better spots for my money companies like msft aapl and other amazing companies dropped 3550 this was an opportunity i would not get again and as hard as it was i had to realize i had time and some risk tolerance to take advantage of this opportunity so i knew selling a stock that had no business being down 20 at a loss and repositioning would be more beneficial long term tldr when shit hits the fan it is natural to pull out or ignore your account but you have to fight that urge it is at that

real estate etf with a benchmark of msci us imi real estate 2550 index it is not one that gets mentioned on here a lot like all real estate investments it took a hit in march and is slow to recover the fund scores a perfect 100 out of 10 analyst rating from xtf if you are going to hold real estate in an etf this is the one to have it may take several months or even a few years for real estate to recover so as long as you are not expecting immediate returns this fund is hopefully a solid long term hold the fund has a distribution yield of a very respectable 38 and should sustain that distribution for the foreseeable future you have almost 12 of your portfolio in this fund and that seems about right to me vti vanguard idx fund vti is a capitalizationweighted nonleveraged passively managed equity etf with the benchmark index of crsp us total market index over the long term the fund performs somewhat similarly to the s amp p 500 index it has the same companies as the top 6 holdings but in different percentages while i personally think a fund that is more topheavy with the faang stocks would perform better over the long haul this is a solid choice and provides great diversification with perhaps slightly less volatility than a more techheavy fund would have vti is a favorite of many people on this subreddit and it is hard to argue against it for a broad market fund it has a solid 9710 analyst rating for a 22 year old my suggestion would be to put some money into qqq which should provide more longterm growth than vti however you would not have to stop investing in vti you could just take what you are putting here and split it between the two there would be a lot of duplication by doing that but i think your portfolio would grow more quickly if you do that I am not a financial expert and this is not financial advice just something to consider vxus vanguard total international stock index fund I am not very fond of total stock funds especially international ones they tend to underperform the s amp p 500 index and if you are going to pick a very broad market fund why not just pick voo or spy however this fund may be the exception to my dislike of international funds the top holdings include baba tencent holdings nestle sa taiwan semiconductor samsung roche holding novartis sap toyota and asml if i were going to invest in a handful of nonus companies these would all be solid choices i would not be surprised if this fund performs at least as well as if not better than the s amp p 500 index over the next fewseveral years it has a 9810 analyst rating from xtf jpm jpmorgan chase is one of the few bank stocks that i own like all bank stocks it took a beating in march and is still trying to recover it is a little early to tell how the unemployment rate and bankruptcies are going to affect the banking industry over the next several months but if any bank can weather the storm jpm should be able to it is a bit of a risky stock for that reason but i think a solid choice for a longterm hold the equity summary score is slightly bearish on jpm with a rating of 4510 the stock does pay dividends with a respectable 357 yield that should continue if i were you i would continue to put 12 or so of your investment dollars here other stocks in this sector include wfc wells fargo bac bank of america and td toronto dominion msft microsoft is probably one of the best companies to have money in right now they have not had the same growth in value as apple amazon facebook and google over the past ten years or so but i think they are poised to do great things in the future I am bullish on msft and i own shares myself microsoft does pay a small dividend but nothing to write home about recognia technical analysts have given microsoft a strong longterm sentiment and s amp p global intelligence suggests that it is slightly undervalued ba boeing co here s where you and i are going to disagree boeing has obviously had issues with their 737 max cancellations are outpacing orders on this flagship airliner and now the faa is looking into issues with the 787 the equity summary score for boeing stock is a very bearish 0310 and recognia technical analysts give it a weak rating for the short term midterm and longterm in fact looking through the various analyst reports i do not see a single analyst that likes this stock boeing could come back but it could take years or even decades to return to pre737 max levels this company has fundamental problems beyond decreased air traffic and i would not touch this one with a ten foot pole there are so many better choices out there if you want to diversify outside of tech consider something like disney coca cola kroger pepsi or best buy amazon google and apple would also be better choices for 11 of your portfolio mar marriott here is another one that the analysts do not like however I am with you on this one of all the hotel stocks out there this one is my favorite their properties are mostly in the midprice to uppermid range they are taking a hit due to the pandemic situation and the analysts are knocking them for that however once the covid situation is over i think marriott will bounce back and continue to be a strong solidperforming company that said the analysts give this an equity summary score of 0610 very bearish and a weak longterm sentiment long term in this context is 9 months to 2 years however s amp p global market intelligence regards the stock as slightly undervalued with a score of 62100 where 100 is most undervalued and 1 is least undervalued they also give the stock a very high quality score 91100 but rank it only 33100 for financial health this last low score is largely due to covid i think marriott bounces back within a few years and i expect you to see good longterm growth but what do i know other options in this sector include hlt hilton and h hyatt the only advice i would give you is that you may want to diversify into a couple of other sectors etfs might be the best way to do that I am bullish on renewableclean energy stocks the best etfs in this sector include icln tan pbw and qcln i have shares in icln tan and pbw I am also bullish on some health care etfs including some that specifically invest in companies on the cusp of genomic technology look for arkg idna xlv and fhlc in this area i have shares in arkg and xlv another etf that I have put some money in is thnq this one invests in companies involved in artificial intelligence and robotics other etfs in this area include robt robo and arkq i hope this helps

advantage of the monster days in the market the basic idea is to write calls and puts atm or to write calls with higher premiums a bit otm to run up some profit obviously you never write an option below the price you bought at or were assigned at unless the stock has been damaged enough that you are confident it will not recover to a certain point at a certain time people have misconceptions about this misconceptions 1 writing options is risky wrong it is literally no different than going long instead you are just also collecting a premium for your troubles the only risk here is singling out certain tickers that might not recover for some time hence the reason you need 100k or more to be able to diversify your positions enough that you are not bagholding on the majority of them 2 avoid volatile stocks my god this one is the most ridiculous of them all the only reason and i mean only reason that you would avoid volatile tickers is because you are emotional volatile stocks pay higher premiums volatile stocks allow you to write on them at big discounts volatile stocks might run up before you sell the call or allow you to collect decent premiums at higher strikes I have seen people list stocks like apple nvda facebook amd and netflix as stocks to avoid when writing options these are literally the very stocks that made us the most money volatility means absolutely nothing if the companies are good and these companies are much more than good 3 what if the market tanks okay so what people cite some quote about picking up pennies on a train track when that was attributed to naked options if you are long anyway then you are in no different position i have absolutely no idea why this is cited as a reason to avoid writing options this mathematically makes absolutely no sense and you can not prove me wrong 4 long dated options stop just stop if you are not writing weeklies you have no idea what you are doing again math the premiums are higher yes they are higher do the math you can better aim your strikes and you do not have to sit there for months on end biting your nails as the market does what it does 5 the object is to make as much premium as possible without my shares being assigned huh this is not a long strategy this is an options strategy the whole idea is to make outsized weekly gains between 14 any capital gains are bonus though they can be big as well in certain cases if you are trying to juggle going long with an options strategy you are just caught in noman s land 6 writing options is a neutral to bearish strategy again why would you listen to your brokerage s tutorial on options trading writing calls and puts works in literally any market except for a crash in which the only good strategy is shorting and good luck to you on that one 7 avoid writing on stocks reporting earnings huh again emotions over logic why do i care if my shares get called away because apple mooned at earnings if I am making 34 on premium in one week why am i getting the fomos why are you dumping amazon because it fell 4 after earnings why are not you instead selling another call at the price you bought stop shooting yourself in the foot 8 you will miss out on dividends this might be the dumbest of them all when I am collecting 14 weekly do you think i give two hits about dividends we once executed a daily spy put at near the market bottom in march that netted over 500 annualized and you are bringing up dividends 9 taxes so you have to pay taxes on money you make would you rather not make money okay then what are we talking about also you can use your ira if you have enough in there enough said here s a brief overview of the strategy you pick stocks you really like and then you check earnings each week do a good balance of quality stocks and quality stocks reporting earnings since the premiums are huge 1 you sell weekly atm calls or cash secured puts if you are a little twitchy about the market sell puts a little further out of the money let us say you sell 15 contracts two of them dip you have made 34 in a week so just sell cheaper calls at a strike equal to the cost of the shares now you can do it all over again with the shares that got assigned or did not if the price was flat or you sold a put you might make slightly less this week but with the constant gains 14 per week is going to constantly increase 2 now for the stocks that you are stuck with get creative but be patient i recently wrote a put on bac at 2850 not my best move but now I am waiting looking to sell longer dated calls wait but you just told us to do weeklies with the stocks that are down not necessarily that is the beauty of the strategy if you go long on bac at 2850 and do not sell anything you are shit out of luck until it recovers at least you can sell a call every day i look at what a 28 call with a month to expiration would net me wait but you said to write only at the price you bought it at well I have already made 50 on the stock and plus i do not think it is going to fully recover in a month now it is at 2611 and i can start looking at decent premiums if they get taken away fine i broke even on that one but for every time that happens far more often I will be down on a stock for long enough that i sell enough calls to still make a decent 130 annualized profit by the time it is called away 3 as for choosing stocks go with what is good it is as simple as that would you buy apple starbucks ebay verizon great then if it is a good time such as earnings season or the stock is at a discount go ahead with it i like to look at the 52 week highs it is great to buy stocks at a discount especially when you have written on that stock before i can not tell you how many contracts we have written on apple it is near a thousand by now same with nvda and netflix we are aggressive because we are emotionless as i said before volatility means absolutely nothing when writing options it is your emotions if nvda drops 20 fine i do not care it is a great stock and at least i collected a premium I would happily go long nvda and in that case i would not be making anything i can not tell you how many times we have bought these stocks at discounts because you fools make the price fluctuate probably 30 of our profits are riding stocks back up and past where they were then writing on them again when they fall again as for choosing stocks with earnings coming out the rules are no different do not write a put on nikola because the premiums are fat ie do not be an idiot but it is also about the price my worst move ever was writing a put on work before the past earnings release i like slack it is early but i think they are doing big things but i sold the put during a runup prior to earnings stupid now I am holding the bag however as proof of how great this strat is though i sold the put at 38 strike I am writing long dated calls at 32 why because I have already made over 600 writing on that stock i literally can not lose same with marriott i wrote so many puts that after writing one at 111 i could write at less than 90 and still come out even i will not because i know it is going to pump after the vaccine announcement and it is still incredibly undervalued but again just another example of how even the losers turn out to be winners if you just run the numbers 4 speaking of running the numbers it all comes down to math you write down the price you bought at andor the strike you sold at you write down the premium then you write down the profit and add to the premium the difference between the price you bought and the call strike recently i wrote a tmus put at 108 prior to earnings it pumped to 116 after but i made 275 do you think i give a poop what i missed out on when i just made over 25 in one week multiple that by 52 weeks and what do you get and yes this is consistently reached last week we made nearly 8000 last month over 30000 after a few years when i can include a longerdated bear market that obviously will not provide as good of returns I would like to eventually try and manualize the strat a lot of it is about temperament one final note 100000 really is a baseline and even then i think you are a little less flexible than you ought to be you need to be able to ride out four or five stocks that have dipped so that you can still write ten or twenty new contracts every week and maintain the cash flow stream"], "predictions": ["positive", "positive", "positive", "neutral", "positive", "positive", "positive", "neutral", "positive", "positive"],

generally special place in the capital markets with an ability to extract value based on the value of other companies either via equity issues or loans so if we just look at those 3 we then have a

great but if i had to own banks the big 3 us banks are consolidating and getting tons of new deposits their size advantage is substantial given increasing regulations and they have some level of

there is tons of upside in deregulation gt the interest rate environment is terrible for banks that means there is tons of upside if interest rates go back to historical norms gt the industry is

bear market or the longer one of a decade ago in fact banks by the nature of their business seem highly prone to blowing up when things go bad unless bailed out which nowadays looks like a near

after the financial crisis took me a decade of holding to make my money back plus a little just in that stock overall i did much better i honestly believe its a good company and a solid brand the one mistake they made and its a big one was buying countrywide that one purchase completely ruined them for a decade and i personally believe they were basically forced into the deal all the banks were forced to absorb other institutions in order to save the system edit still would not personally buy it again though", "bac looks strong on paper but they are probably the most exposed to interest rates of all the banks consumer lending is a big part of the equation as well expect a lot of sideways movement for some time", "yea and i use bac as a consumer and i think they are pretty good also i actually use to work as a software engineer at a bank and i can tell you they are tech companies as well they automate lot s of stuff", "i can not see the yous going to negative rates it would hurt the banks too much and america does not want the banks to be too strained current bank accounting cecl is very conservative so the banks are throwing an incredible amount of money into reserves and are probably being overconservative in their estimates for losses on mortgages and credit cards what is good about this is that once the loan is done it does not hit the income statement twice if the banks can manage through covid well enough they can recognize loss reserves as revenue earned in prior periods and i think buffett has been able to figure out his upside when it comes to bac in regards to future earnings that were earned in prior periods", "I will agree with you on some of this stuff here some of bac s competitors are cheaper and more attractive ameris bank for example is actively acquiring banks and are a regional bank growing in the southeastern us they bought out fidelity bank and on their most recent annual report they had an internal failure when it came to accounting for the auto loans they took on from fidelity bank of the james is a small commercial bank in lynchburg va that does a lot of business in the growing charlottesville and appomattox areas a quiet hunch has me wondering if they do a lot of lending to liberty university because they are one of the largest colleges in their area silvergate bank over in ca accepts cryptocurrencies into their noninterest bearing deposits and only have a handful of locations there is cheaper banks out there but realistically speaking how much of a return can i expect from those investments i can see silvergate being bought out by a larger player that wants to get into crypto lending i know gs is doing it but bac and wfc have sworn away from it if it becomes profitable then i can see them being acquired i do not understand acquisition accounting so i have to stay away from ameris bank and since they had an internal failure in their financial controls i can not necessarily trust that is the only one they will ever have since I am not smart enough yet to figure out acquisition accounting bank of the james does not have enough business in their area so when their value is going to be unlocked and reflected in the share price with bac you get their financial strength and value being unlocked because the market has its eyes on it buying into banks right now is a bet on interest rates directly or indirectly so I am willing to bet on their moving up at some point in the nearfar future", "i think bac will take a while to recover but i am also invested in btg it is not a long term hold for me but in the near future i think it will keep going up because of all the money being printed", "everything I have read about buffet is that he likes predictable earnings but with the threats of lowernegative rates mortgage defaults and fintec like sq it seems the future of bac earnings is anything but certain", "i believe bac is expensive the banking industry is heavily regulated the interest rate environment is terrible for banks the industry is very competitive and there are very low growth prospects most of these banks will get through credit losses just fine but i do not understand the appeal the industry used to attract top talent 1520 years ago but it no longer does i think buffett is living in the past and the economy of today is structurally very different than what it was decades ago bac is trading at 89 of book which I am sure supports the case to buy but if you look around the world at other banks 89 of book is actually expensive credit agricole is 37 of book bnp paribas is 42 credit suisse is 51 barclays is 30 socgen is 18 not a typo mitsubishi ufj is 33 sumitomo mitsui is 35 and it continues for all of these I am not even mentioning db these are the good banks i think us banks are going to have a very hard time earning their cost of equity capital and should trade below book accordingly in this very low rate environment and they have to answer to their regulator if they want to repurchase shares and increase their dividend it is an unattractive industry and i do not think bac s valuation is attractive when citing other comparable banks in the developed world i think us banks are expensive and he is living in the past", "i had jpm on my watchlist for a while and bought a few positions averaging 82 shr during the pandemic waiting for returns once things recover did not check bac much valuations looked a lot better at the time however revenues and earnings were lower this q1 but that was because they added some 7b to loan loss provisions to increase reserves preparing for pandemic related defaults from business lending retail real estate and credit cards however these decisions were probably made at the peak of pandemic panic before government intervention and ppp loans so this should not fully materialize they had a huge gain from the trading division some 7b which was a 30 increase", "cheaper probably 09 pb for bac vs 13 for jpm", "earnings were nice bac has great management and i believe buffet is looking for some nice dividends on an undervalued stock", "I have been holding a lot for a long time haha bac is something

is just speculation", "forget bac they have the biggest holdings of aapl", "you bring up good points however i i got lucky and bought the lion s share of my stake the day the market crashed in march dumped as much as i could into them so far so good so in some way yeah you have to have cash on the sidelines and be ready i was which was the plan ii rates can stay low for a long time but not forever my hunch is that the fed is quietly trying to stoke inflation by printing money excessively now so the national debt can be paid down in inflated dollars and that will ease high deficit burdens we did this in the 1950s i can see the fed doing that i can also see them raising rates to clear out speculative interests in the markets like they did in 1928 and 1929 hardly the same circumstances since we were on the gold standard but the desire to quell out speculative forces may be all the same iii whatever the hell buffett sees is beyond me because berkshire is a microcosm of the economy he owns a little bit of everything and I am sure he gets an incredible amount of information sifted to him from his insurance subsidiaries all the time his information is as fresh as it comes does he see increased velocity being created due to pent up demand from the closures therefore stoking inflation does he see the fed being cornered into raising rates so banks can be more profitable to get through a more severe covid based financial crisis is he just going to play the waiting game for rates to climb slowly and hold onto bac in the meantime i have no clue but his moves are always more detailed than just buy and hold and wait and see i have a feeling it is a mix of his eagle eye view with fresh insurance information and his shrugging his shoulders at larger economic movements and knowing that bac is safe whatever happens", "but banks are not toast though banks all across the board are sitting on heavy capital ratios a lot of them can withstand heavy losses when it comes to foreclosures and credit writedowns wfc is not toast in the worst of the drawdowns and the most recent fed stress tests showed that gs would be utterly fucked i doubt buffett would want to buy out a regional or commercial bank because he does not want to turn berkshire into a bank holding company bac may be the only cheap option that he could get permission to keep buying in that would give a good return on his investment and one that he can pour money into without him making a dent in bac itself they have an enterprise valuation of almost half a trillion buffett buying 1b in shares is nothing", "buffet is yoloing on bac they will be fine", "a taco shop i heard apple was going to moon today at jcpennys i think buffet is putting money in bac mixed with closing branches that sounds like a moonshot tendies for el retardados", "i like jpm better but bac is probably a good bet too if a good recovery after covid and a vaccine happen pretty soon they are both down pretty good so it would be a nice increase in stock price if they returned to pre covid levels", "it could be a survival of the fittest play if banks are toast except bac has some angles as far as not being to exposed

bac but had been holding them since 2004 and i figured if i sold it I would capture some profits and could either buy back the stock in a couple of weeks or redeploy to something else near term or long term the stuff i sold is still below where i sold it my biggest mistake was getting bored during lock down messing around with options and using real money instead of paper trading kinda fucked myself pretty hard my roth ira and brokerage accounts used to be pretty even now there is about a 40000 gap between the two one i messed with the other i left alone i moved a little bit of money in the roth ira but it was like 2 that had been cash bought something decided i liked another idea more tbh most of my losses came from doing things that were either good ideas i got out of too early or 1 really bad idea ie bets against delta watches delta go up 10 in a pandemic lol what next day gives it all back i make back te little i lost take a small profit and move on delta crashes from the 40s to the 20s three weeks later that position i made 100 on 800 bet would have made me 4500 profit on an 800 bet turn 1700 into 3400 on an electric trucking company decide hey this is going bonkers if i toss a truck load of money at it and it moves even 20 i make bank it moved 20 down buys amazon calls for 4000 price after watching it run from 1500 3000 set a sell order at 100 two days later up 30 went shit a few days like this and I will hit 100 stupid fast does math hey if i hit 165 i make back all the money I have lost moves sell price up to 165 two days later it hits 100 day 3 it crashes and i get out with 40 profit had i done nothing and left it alone I would have earned 100 and not 40 bought a tesla call for a couple grand spent too much slow lockdown time watching things sold when it went down 20 3 weeks later it is 230 higher considered buying tesla shares at 1000 actually bought 2 sold an hour later a week later dropped model 3 money on 45 tesla shares at 1200 made like 15share and got out even if I would held like 2 weeks i could have made up to 40 had i not fucked up with workhorse and left my amazon sell order alone I would have 27000 in my account more than i do now holding the tesla shares or calls could have made me anywhere from 5k to 27k i have some bets that the market is going to go down a few of them are small options meaning if my timing is off i could lose mostly betting against the market as whole but i have a bet that disney will go down 15 between now and september do not know if it will fall that far but falling at all would make me some money if the market pulls back my silver call should go up my plays against the market will too and that will hopefully help me fill in some of the gap the other side of the coin is I am building a list of the things i want to buy and then hold for the next 520 years and buying a share or two here and there sure they might go down but if the position is 10shares and i plan on buying it for several years in a row losing a dollar here or there just means my average price does not go up a ton when i buy more", "bought more bac today"], "predictions": ["positive", "negative", "positive",

loans the jpm but especially bac are almost certainly making a killing there more loans processed in a quarter than multiple years combined 2 this is different from 08 in the sense that the banks were the bad guys then in this case they did not because the recession they have had 12 years of fed induced stress tests to prepare and they are the industry facilitating the fed s tools and getting paid well for it 3 the banks are going to understate how well they are doing partially because they do not want to look like the bad guys again this seemed to be the theme of the previous earning season when they allocated a ton of their capital to accommodate potential losses on loans i think they were intentionally overestimating the impact of covid and rightly so because that is their job always better to underpromise and overdeliver right we will see for sure this week 3 banks took an additional hit when buffett sold all of gs and some of the rest of his bank stocks but what was missed is that he sold some of his bank holdings to get his ownership just under 10 to avoid insider status and he likely sold all of gs because they are in the middle of expanding into consumer banking with their marcus platform 4 interest rates are low and yes that affects bank profitability to an extent but jpow is adamant that we are not going negative which means rates can only go up lol in the meantime this presents the buy and hold investor with year ish opportunity 5 commercial real estate is hurting but residential is booming due to the low rates banks also make money on the underwriting 6 the fact that most banks came out of the stress test and did not cut dividends is hella bullish for me wfc is the exception but they have self inflicted wounds legal expenses due to their fake account scandale full disclosure i do not like wfc 7 a big reason banks do buybacks is because there is very few things they are allowed to do with money that changes with the repeal of the volcker rule lt lt this is slipping past a lot of people but it means that bank can now invest alongside their clients more risk but certainly more reward and I would rather they did then get back into

about how events can change so much literally overnight in 20082009 we had plenty of time to process the decline it did not happen over night but there is nothing anyone can do about it once you are in you are in stocks regularly move both up and down 15 within a year it is often too late to sell when it becomes clear this is something more severe and serious than usual since i have lived through 20082009 and all the short term declines in 2011201220182019 i do not think emotionally either it will recover or it will not i was not necessarily upset because a global pandemic is a once in a 100 year thing 2012 taught me to never overleverage myself i keep margin to a very respectable level 50k borrowed for every 100k in cash i plan for large declines just in case for the past two years i have built up a small cash reserve i borrowed cheaply in february and when the market stuff happened in march i borrowed more this credit has now dried up for the time being so i am pleased i am essentially good for 12 months from a cash perspective my mistake was buying too early with money i put into my account i bought xom right before the saudi nonsense and i bought c before the bottom i actually sold for a loss and put it into january 2022 call options on jpm bac and a few others i made up the losses and have a profit for the money i put in i learned i am better off buying options after these huge declines than stocks i sold my gm for a long term loss i put the money into c because c has a tangible book value of 72 and 52 week high of 82 i am much more confident about c returning to the highs being undervalued from a book value basis than gm this was a good opportunity to get out of gm i learned my lesson never buy stock in a company dominated by unions unions will always hold a company down 62 an hour for the average factory worker i sold bac for a long term loss and put it into c i now have a big loss this year which will offset my trading and option gains this year and carry over next year on my taxes i now have 60 in c 30 in cfg citizens is undervalued based on tangible book value pays a 5 dividend and is a takeover target for pnc 10 are in january 2022 call options for bk bank of new york mellon i feel comfortable in these leap options although i could make a lot more with shorter term options once i recover my losses and make a good profit from where i was in february i may change my strategy i do bank stocks and individual stocks because i was up 1500 since november 2008 those opportunities have dried up and i understand the ease and safety of an index fund i might just put 40 in voo i might put 20 in 10 different call options maybe leaps or individual stocks i might keep 40 in cash maybe I will just try to day trade voo maybe I

with them so just going to focus on what you have and my opinion on it regarding value in general it is just my observation most investors are now focused on growth stock and tech so i was expecting a what tech stocks or which etfs should i buy now type of question i get both styles and invest in both strategies myself so that is the only reason my assumption sorry if I am not correct is that your portfolio size is not that big so the concentration is actually over emphasized say it is 10k or something than split over 4 stocks i would say that is actually reasonable due to cost of commission and that fact you will continue to build out portfolios so the concentration will rapidly shrink as you add more positions if you had say 100k or 1mm i would be much more worried and tell you to diversify more i think the stocks are all high quality and you have some sector diversification obviously there is risk if one of the companies fail you will lose a big chunk and you have pointed out the pfe weight but you have chosen to accept and understand this risk to generate excess return would you do better if you simply held an s amp p500 etf quite possibly but i believe the most important thing is to consistently invest in a manner that you are comfortable doing and the bigger factor when starting to invest is actually building up savings it is not until you have over 100k when the returns from the portfolio start outpacing the growth from cash contributions ie if you are investing 1000 the difference between a 5 return and 10 return is 50 not as significant from a absolute perspective but becomes more important when the investment size is larger so early on the emphasis should be on savings this is a quick estimation of what i would think your portfolio could do on average over your time horizon it could be more or less depending on growth assumptions i used conservative figures this is also just on average so year to year it will fluctuate more i would guess about 8 total return over say a 35 year period you could also see a nice pop on recovery but i did not assume that sorry the chart is not aligned i coped and pasted from excel but i think you can

dramatically outperform the rest of the holdings I am just looking for some opinions on several situations where it seems it may be better to add a particular stock rather than the entire etf for the long term 1 unh unitedhealth group vs vht vanguard healthcare etf this would exclude pharmaceuticals but i do intend to also hold ihi which focuses on medical devices i expect the pharma company that discovers the curevaccine for covid19 will skyrocket but in an etf that would be tempered by all the other holdings anyway so unless you can pick the winner it may not matter 2 nee nextera energy vs vpu vanguard utilities etf despite the name nee is not in the energy sector but a utility that has significantly outperformed over the past several years and has been expanding into renewable energy through their subsidiary i have seen a few other utility stocks that have performed admirably such as awk but not a single utility etf that is not saddled heavily by its weaker holdings 3 amt american tower vs srvr data amp tech reit etf despite the name amt is actually tilted toward international expansion along with its domestic business so it has the opportunity to reach new markets with less competition srvr is a bit unusual as a reit it has a low dividend high expense ratio and has only been around a short time however it holds a combination of the top performing cell tower data center fiber networking and similar reits such as amt sbac cci eqix etc other reits containing the same holdings such as xlre perform more traditionally low growth high dividend but I am interested in long term growth rather than income which suggests i should not touch reits at all but there is a pressing need worldwide for data and communication operations inspiring growth 4 jpm jp morgan vs vfh vanguard financials etf simple logic here banks have been hammered hard by the virus but money has to flow and eventually they will recover though they might suffer to get there if defaults become a more common theme over the next few months so that recovery could take awhile jpm or alternatively bac have been excellent performers in the long run however i realize it may instead be best to hold

12 months with depressed revenues the biggest risk comes from regional banks if a specific region is hit very hard for a couple of months like nyc they might struggle because their main source of income is exclusive to that area they can not outsource the driver of their income enough to offset the hit from their bread and butter for example i work in florida the last few weeks have been tougher than march or april as cases have skyrocketed in florida and the mayor of miami is considering another shutdown of the city large banks are actually not as exposed as you might be likely to believe post gfc large banks became increasingly complex due to regulatory measures if i am not mistaken around 50 of jpm and bac revenues are noninterest bearing interest rates could be 1 or 10 and it would not make a difference to 50 of their revenues large banks are increasingly relying their revenues from things like ipos bond issuances credit card fees and m amp as in other words they are

dropping at least 2k a month and I am within reach of less than a year luckily i had an aunt wealthy who passed away and gave me 10k to invest with i made some dumb option trades and lost some money about 15k but i feel like I am getting better and more used to how the markets work bcuz of my job i made a few good picks in my roth account and doubled it already so i almost have enough in that account to put a down payment on a house 10k and since the irs does not tax first time homes i take out the money tax free i want to buy a house soon and will prolly spend minimal any to get it in

this it was a long running joke that the mandated work on our data warehouses was never going to get done in time and the only reason any project managers prioritized it is because the mandate meant

interestmaximizing algorithms for international banking clients they would much rather be finding ways to move liquidity around so mandates like this test fall to the wayside until it is a

just taking what it gives over and over for 1030 cent gains i normally do not play banks but use them as an indicator if i do play the 2020i only do bac and jpm I have probably traded the bac 35c s 8 times and just kinda noticed them sitting kinda low for the past 10 days but i noticed that after the massive 10 run up banks had this month they were kinda flat last week i used finviz and looked at weekly and monthly gains for them on the heatmap i also noticed that jpms increases monthly and weekly were a solid few points behind the other banks same with the weekly i know dimon is out of the hospital and well and do believe that much of jpms value comes from him individually so i figured breaking 100 should not be too difficult just need two good bank days it was over 110 i believe when you were trading it no so resistance is much higher than my calls yea it does seem like we got some serious fomo with tech right now everything slowly rallied over the last month to catch up now its back to tech if i had to bet on one other industry also rising it has to be banks dividend stocks risk being cut as the yields are too high travel is beat up for a reason you are right people are not paying rent but i think in terms of massive loans to companies we have not seen a surge in bankruptcies that would scare me what is a hertz or two there is tons of competition in those industries if an airline fell it would be worse but still i do not think one failing would be catastrophic the banks would recoup a large portion while shareholders eat dirt fed will not let the banks fail but i

down up until around 2 pm i bought calls of it early and sold them for a loss and then waited and caught a little profit from calls on a bounce around 12201 i count myself lucky with my timing on that trade that i took my profit on the bounce because bac quickly retreated back down after 110 and continued to trend back down so i bought the call around 1220 for 34 and then sold it at 37 around 1pm during that time period bac price went from like 24652492 but then from 12 pm the price of bac went down from 2492 amp nbsp gt to about 2449 and the call option which i was watching and had traded for my two trades bac 26 626 call option went from 39 at 1pm to 3 at 2pm when the stock was around its lowest price of the day and volume was very high as well but then from 24pm almost the entire banking sector and dow spy qqq basically all trended up the rest of the day to 4pm i watch a few other banking stocks at the same time and found the bac 26 626 call was barely moving from 3 while other bank stocks call option trading only a small fraction of the volume that bac s call options were were all gaining price fast relative to bac call options amp nbsp gt i ended up deciding to go with citigroup and bought c 53 626 call option at 224pm for 128 and then sold it at 316 for 151 that is almost an 18 rise during the same period of time the bac 26 626 call only went from like 3236 or about a 10 rise i mean the thing I am confused about is that the bac option vs the citigroup option only rose about half 10 vs 20 than the c option i acknowledge i probably am not explaining this well and that i have little knowledge with options could anyone understand what I am talking about and help me reason why the bac call option rose about only half the percent that the c option rose in the same time frames from 2330 amp nbsp gt also like i said about the volume the 26 bac call option had volume of around 5000 by 2pm while the c call option only had only maybe 300 and the price difference was basically 33 vs 13 so it seems like the price of the bac call option should have exploded when bac s stock price rose vs c stock price rising at a similar rate correlation it is late and i might not be making sense but if anyone can she would some light on this I would appreciate it it is really confusing me why the bac call did not rise as much percentage as the c call option and i would have guessed based on the volume that the bac option would actually go higher percentage but yea it did only about half amp nbsp hey youprogress33mystic it looks like you posted a wall of text

everything in economics every action has a pain and a gain and we maximize at the point in which both side cancel each other a lot of people seem to think that printing us money can be done without any pain due to the seignorage of the us dollar but this argument only holds up until a certain critical threshold in which net creditor countries lose enough purchase power from their us debt holding

government structure to prevent calamity both economic and health wise i belief this will give them a leg up over the coming years furthermore taking the opportunity to use this crisis to invest heavily on green tech and infrastructure seems a better policy than just going back to what the world was precovid last thing is you are investing in adr from european countries like i do since i am

regulation that larger banks must comply with both on the cost side stress testing etc and on the revenue side durbin amendment etc so community banks can be leaner and generate higher returns on

stocks got a bid on monday as fears over the sector s profits abated following remarks by federal reserve chairman jerome powell bank stocks have lagged behind the broader market as low interest rates and the fear of negative interest rates coupled with a weak economy is expected to pressure profits but on sunday powell while acknowledging that the economy may take time to recover again threw cold water on the notion of negative rates the evidence on whether it helps is quite mixed powell said in an interview with 60 minutes it can also tend to depress the profitability of banks which makes them likely to lend less which weighs on economic growth so i would just say it is not at all settled in you know in economic analysis that negative rates really add much value bank stocks soared early monday with the kbw nasdaq bank index bkx climbing 66 outpacing gains in s amp p 500 which was up 32 shares of jpmorgan jpm were up 46 citigroup c up 64 bank of america bac up 52 and wells fargo wfc up 69 it was a rare bullish day for the banks whose stocks have slid since february even though many including powell have highlighted the health of the sector after the last financial crisis the banks more than doubled their capital and liquidity and they are far more aware and better at managing the risks they are taking powell said referring to the financial crisis of 200809 they are so much stronger than they were before the financial crisis the last financial crisis investors may have less fear about banks going under but they know profits will be weak many banks have halted buybacks and some dividends may be under pressure one needs to look no further than the performance of bank bonds compared with their stocks to witness this split sentiment on the sector before monday

have sent positive signals about banks equity investors have not frederick cannon managing director at kbw said in a note if there is consistency between bond and equity investors this suggests that market participants overall believe that bank balance sheets are safe but that bank profitability has been put at significant risk unfortunately history is not a reliable guide to when bank stocks will see outperformance during the recovery kbw identified 12 market downturns since 1997 and found that in the three months following the s amp p 500 s trough bank stocks performance ranged from

definition to differentiate between the two is this from benjamin graham and david dodd an investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return operations not meeting these requirements are speculative investors are drawn to income whereas speculators are drawn to profit one is not better than the other but it is imperative that you

are great do not get me wrong but they are expensive and do not offer as much growth as individual stocks you are young so you can afford to side with risk but we will try our best not to lose which

when bac was about 2 lower and delta is 72 now delta is the ratio between the movement in the option price to the movement of the underlying so 2 x 72 is 144 which added to the price you picked it up at would be 555 144 699 the current price is a bit lower probably because volatility dropped this week I would say the price is about where it should be you are not getting ripped off the leverage comes from reaping a fraction of the gains from all 100 shares vs the 26 you could have bought otherwise until your option is deep itm or about to expire aka can not go tits up delta will be less than one so you do not quite get the full effect of all 100 shares that is because there is still risk that the bears are right and the option crashes otm before expiration even if it were a sure thing and delta was 1 you would have an option worth 755 which will not get the 10x leverage you asked about for that kind of gain you would need cheap options which are the riskiest i like the long dated call play the hard part will be knowing when to take your profit", "don t be sorry no i don t no what I am doing but what i do know is that those companies have strong fundamentals and in the long run they

it and htbx is just a gamble", "honestly not great 4 stocks is not a portfolio it is a gamble this looks like you have just constructed a random portfolio using stocks on the trending page of

in the last 2 months and your weighting is all over the place while i agree individual stock picking has its place your selection of stocks has no real strengths ccl is a gamble as is dal and htbx I

concerning for delays in technological investments due to financial set backs globally my biggest worry but my fundamental view of many of the companies I have been buying has not fundamentally changed these companies are still solid long term they still have massive potential long term if i sell any of it it will be a portion to raise cash if i saw something i thought was a real opportunity and did not have enough cash to buy the stake i wanted aside from that though most my stuff I am holding delayed investment and progress would suck but it is not like it would cease to happen just a bit longer than hoped now if i was heavily invested in transportation energy entertainment etc i would have probably been freaking out and saw the 30 rebound as a prime opportunity to unload significant portions of that but that would not happen because i would not hold that stuff long term to begin with banks are probably the only sector where despite the negative news I would hold out if i had a significant stake in jpm or bac I would probably hold no matter what rebound downturn whatever because I would feel fairly confident they would eventually bounce back truth be told though i sold most my banking holdings years ago to move more of it into tech i think i might be too big a believer it ultimately worked out my working theory right now is tech stocks are the new flight to safety the bond market is all sorts of screwed up right now the fed saw to that and many stocks are full of uncertainty people see these tech stocks and think these companies do not just weather the shut down they thrive in it this stuff is not going anywhere and they are flocking to them running prices up it is left me an unhappy camper obviously because now it is much more expensive to buy the stuff I have liked buying the last few years to the point i do not really want to buy any more of them now I am hoping that something will happen to make people revert to undervaluing technology but

like msft and amzn took huge dips way beyond what was reasonable even preferred stocks from bac and jpm which had around 6 yields dropped 25 way below their call price last few weeks everything was going up no matter what because people are optimistic that this is short term and things will go relatively back to normal i do not think we will see normal for at least 1836 months moving forward you are going to see a lot more sectors split some up some down there is going to be higher volatility and volume than norm but probably not like we have seen the last 45 days it is going to be a stock pickers dream i do not expect the market to move up 20 or down more than 20 but i do expect a lot of stocks will we are going to be in a different world after this and that will really favor some companies while others will die a quick death i do not know for sure obviously but i think market will be down around 10 over the next 12 months after that m amp a will become a huge strategy and

stock market down so much so quickly you will probably never have another chance to start owning ko coca cola or bac bank of america at these prices shares of ko are more stable than the us dollar and at the current price pays a 364 dividend that will likely drop in the short term but if you expect coke to exist when you are older that is a good one if you expect people will still be using banks and credit cards bac is a similar story you might want to look into reits which are a popular way to invest in real estate through a type of etfs they are required by law to pay a large percentage of their rent to shareholders as dividends normally reits would be exactly the thing you are asking about but with current events a reit that specializes in renting property to strip malls and hotels might have it is customers going out of business where one that specializes in renting houses might not be able to collect rent at all for months due to stimulus and other recent changes a reit specializing in renting property to hospitals is probably going to do well regardless i would normally say that is the nice safe boring investment you are looking for but you might find the stock price going up as data on other types of reits start coming in and people flee to safety once the economy is back to normal you could sell out of them hopefully for a profit and divide up into other types of reits in a year or two amp x200b either way as a young investor do not be too scared to gradually buy well known dividend paying stocks that you are personally familiar with the upside of starting investing during a crash is that you are sort of taking a time machine back years you are on track to wealth with your 200600 dollar goal perfect age perfect timing perfect strategy to

days and the high of 260 for at least 2 other days so you definitely had chances to take profit what i would suggest is selling partial of your position when your in good profit example sell a third at 215 another third at 250 and then old the rest or something like that that way your not all or nothing you got in at the perfect time as their was only a 181 oi on 39 and now the oi is 1200 with 1700 contracts traded today i feel sometime soon you should be able to sell over 2 a suggestion i learned the hard way always know your stop and profit targets even for options if you do not know your profit target you do not sell in profit and want more more more that thinking erases your profit this is the best advice you can find here i like your position i checked when you got in the iv for june was 66 now it is 88 if you do not want to be married in the 619 then set an stop order for 130 and get out if the contract goes back to where you bought it at 130 you will make the most money when it goes more itm so if bac goes to 15 or 16etc soon then that is when your tendies print as you have itm value plus lots of extrinsic value but unsure if that will happen i think it will but idk june is 2 months away so you have time next week the options market is pricing a bac stock price between 2142 and 1822 so if bac drops to near 18 you will make good tendies but the question is will you take that profit and live another day or hold it for the yolo", "i bought 10 contracts at 130 on march 9th 619 17p honestly it was a shot in the dark we were coming off a good score from ual and

amp paste a great answer from wsb on the total picture to keep the lights on in the mcdonald s toy factory in hubei well three months later sales have not made up for lost revenue during the quarantine and yong jiang becomes insolvent and defaults on his loan that default makes its way back up the ladder to jpm now jpm can either default on its loan from the fed and bonds get dumped on the market or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back jpm has made this calculation and decided fuck no it wants none of that the problem is though that the loan has already been taken out by yong jiang say yong jiang s bank needs some liquidity because yong defaults well jpm has stopped taking fed repos because of the risk so there is no money to buy on the market and yong s bank fails this happens dozens of times across dozens of countries pretty soon the international banking industry faces systemic collapse for reference the global repo market is valued at 12t usd and only 34 of it is backed by pristine collateral government bonds that means that 3t of it is in equities or derivatives the fed s balance sheet is only 4t usd in comparison additionally 5t is in private capital groups which are entirely opaque and likely have rotten fucking lending standards no way to see who they are lending to or what collateral they are taking we are already seeing this beginning india s yes bank is about to be nationalized due to you guessed it liquidity problems it is been involved in shadow lending practices and american liquidity is starting to dry up across the world china is also heavily dependent on eurodollars but I am not sure how that relationship will shake out their economy might be so big and so vital that we are forced to prop them up if not china s banking system will go tits up too the question then becomes is the fed willing and able to meet global liquidity demands and beyond this how do they force pdbs to keep printing eurodollars and continue to assume risk risk which may violate their fiduciary obligation to shareholders trilliondollar question so what does all this mean who can we short honestly this is hard to say personally i have september puts on bac for 18 and I am still looking for anyone else who might be vulnerable any of the pdbs with accounts at the fed might be at risk I am going to start hunting for se asian african and south american banks that ve been taking repo money those are likely to be the most probable to fail on top of that as banks start dropping like flies and the global economy tanks the usd is going to fucking moon that is a worthwhile bet too the issue here is that the repo market is anonymous so it is hard to follow the money if anyone has any recommendations for specific banks or lending groups to target or look into more please feel free to let me know if the global banking industry started to fail though look for it to hit full swing later this year this is going to be driven by large amounts of defaults that will be spurred by the manufacturing disruptions the extent of which will not be fully felt until at least midway through this year add a few months for missed loan payments and I am wagering that you will see banks start really failing by august or september", "yeah that is my worry too my other play is alternating bac puts and calls it is been super steady

the stable and growing dividends of a dividend aristocrat safe blue chip let us take bank of america bac for instance you want 20k euro year so let us convert to usd 2236780 usd let us assume there is a dividend withholding tax since you are not american I will put 15 because that is a common percentage if the country has a treaty with the us else it is 25 i think to have 2236780 net with a 15 tax you will need 2631506 usd bac currently pays 018 per share per trimester so 072 per year and the dividend grows a little bit every year and the share price is currently 2051 so you will need 36549 shares of bac to receive 2236780 with a 15 withholding tax this will pay 559200 per trimester this amounts in a total invested amount of 74961999 so to summarize my example invest 74961999 in bac which amounts in 36549 shares priced at 2051 each bac will pay you a dividend of 559200 per trimester so 2236780 per year if we assume a withholding tax of 15 on foreign dividends the dividends is stable and will increase every year i simply selected bac as an example but you could do it with any solid and stable company that have a stable and solid dividend policy and does not cut their dividends bac yields 351 currently so obviously you could reduce the invested amount if the dividend yield is higher let us take bank of montreal bmo which is smaller but still safe which yields 701 on the canadian side where I am from with bmo you would only need to invest 522357 33573846 euro to get 20000 euro per year"], "predictions": ["negative", "neutral", "negative", "neutral", "negative",

timedelayed wave of infections before they even know they are sick bear in mind that chinese medical staff were tiktokking about this late dec19 the real danger is threefold overwhelmed medical stafffacilities panic in the masses and labor shortages overwhelmed medical facilities can not cure everyone people will lose loved ones people will commit suicide people will succumb to depression and malaise people will suffer lifelong effects panic will make people hurt others ruin social communities backstab and take advantage and otherwise fend for themselves labor shortages starting in china the manufacturing capital of the world are beginning to be felt across the global economy now death and panic are easy and intuitive it should be obvious why those are bad on the large scale but quarantines and people not working when jpow announced a 5 prime rate cut just 3 weeks ahead of the fomc meeting was when we should have known this shit was for real with labor and production shortages in china se asia and india the world has lost a whole month of manufacturing from basic machined parts to hitech components there is a buffer it is insufficient because of the timedelayed infection rate as asian workers miss work they can not make loan payments on a consumer level this would be a bad hiccup and maybe a fart however with manufacturing quotas being missed industrial and commercial loan payments are being missed enter the eurodollar this instrument is leveraged 19 by us banks in international branches many branches are using trash collateral mixed with shit collateral to back the loans given to asian workers and facilities with covid19 rapidly spreading throughout the us the banks are desperate to reduce their exposure to int l markets and bunker down for recession but they can not too many asians are missing loan payments which means the banks providing those loans are missing payments which means the big boys like bac jpm wfc citi are not able to lower their exposure to a slowly cracking foundation of ultraleveraged debt instruments as the disease spreads throughout europe they too will quarantine and cripple their industry the timedelayed nature of the shutdowns and illnesses will because a lack of buyers for much of the newlyrestored asian manufacturing as well as crippling the supply of certain hitech components which are subsequently required as input for asian manufacturing again asian loan payments are not met however now european loan payments are not met meanwhile the big us banks are and this is what is happening now absolutely fucking scrambling to move their cash from equities into safe havens treasuries are at historic lows as banks position to satisfy reserve requirements gold is shooting up and down as margin calls are being sent out and hedgers liquidate but since the world can not make its loan payments the actual amount of physical us dollars is insufficient to satisfy congressional requirements of fractional reserves

interbank rate called the federal funds ff rate this is the amount of interest banks can charge when they lend to each other to meet temporary liquidity needs so the ff rate is interest that us banks charge each other if they are willing to lend to each other there is another interest called the discount rate this is the interest that the federal reserve charges to any us banks that ask to borrow money from the fed to meet liquidity needs this happens sometimes because jpm might deem bac as a shit bank and they do not wish to lend them any money at the ff rate anyways so what happens is bac goes to the fed with its tail between its leg and asks for money because bac has been a bad puppy the fed charges a higher interest rate than the ff rate to give temporary cash to bac and hence why the fed is called the lender of last resort it is the bank of banks now here comes the reverse repo rr market this is a market that behaves exactly like the interbank or overnight lending market only it is open to finance related entities and companies that are not traditional banks and have no access to the interbank lending market the rr market has the exact same interest rate as the ff rate the federal reserve is the lender and it is basically lending money to nonbank entities that have the collateral to support the loans the loan terms are very short usually for 2 weeks the feds have to keep the target rate for the rr market to be exactly the same as the ff rate otherwise the intended flow of money does not go exactly as the feds want i can tell you spent time researching about this so i will take your word for it when you say us banks have been tangled up as the liquidity providers for foreign banks even still though can you please tell me how you found out that us banks are lending to foreign banks like that now us banks always had access to unlimited liquidity through the overnight lending program from the feds before as long as they can post collateral so I am trying to connect the dots of how the us banks are only just now lending to foreign banks somehow because of the rr market that bank of england study you linked is interesting i will read it for sure if you have similar papers that links the us banks to the foreign banks then I would appreciate it if you can share them with me", "tldr 18 puts bac", "solid dd bac puts it is", "why bac you guess they will

foreign bank gt that bank lends it to a private capital fund gt that fund loans it to businesses those funds are popular in developing regions like south america and se asia the big domestic liquidity brokers pdb like jpm have been getting increasingly stingy with their lending and the repos have been incentives for them to lend abroad again if the domestic liquidity brokers stop lending foreign liquidity drops foreign liquidity drops foreign businesses fail which kicks off a chain reaction all the way back to us markets the covid supply disruption is creating a massive need for foreign liquidity as businesses are in dire need of cash to manage their expenses basically once these foreign businesses start to fail and the big banks like jpm and bac park their cash at the fed to wait it out the international banking system might collapse so these repo measures lately have been the fed s attempt to entice the big banks to prop up failing systems all over the world and the banks being

fed was planning to cut repo lending to zero by april to maintain the balance sheet for tax season also around 100b in repo payments mature in the next week or so which wipe out the 100b that just got pumped into the market if the repo lending slows down or ceases right now banks are going to start massive selloffs if the repo lending continue the fed might start running their accounts reaaally low

irrelevant now s dividends are mathematically irrelevant the video you linked to is rock solid here are some notes to explain why many beginner investors do not realize that paying a dividend is like writing yourself a check they think it is free money it is not it reminds me of another common beginner mistake that stock sells for 5 it must be cheap that stock sells for 100 it must be expensive dividends have no impact on returns all other things remaining equal however it is not true that all other things remain equal companies do not randomly decide to pay dividends therefore the type of company that pays dividends is different from the type of company that does not pay a dividend for example mature largecaps with substantial cashflow generation usually pay a dividend therefore it is possible for dividendpaying stocks to underperform or overperform the market despite the fact that dividends are irrelevant regarding bank of america s claim bac describes this winning strategy as follows to be clear this strategy is not to be confused with most dividend investing strategies where investors hunt for stocks with high payouts but also dependable balance sheets this strategy is to blindly buy the stocks with the highest dividend yields in the market a move that can lead investors into some of the very riskiest stocks it is important to note that as a stock s price drops it is dividend yield rises therefore the stocks that were hardest hit would have had some of the highest dividend yields on january 1st 2009 when this index was built this article is basically telling us that buying the most beatendown stocks in the middle of a recession can lead to outperformance bac explains as much in the following statement following the financial crisis stock prices plummeted for financial companies and others that investors feared were on the brink of insolvency pushing the dividend yields of those stocks to high levels for those companies and likely macy s today the high dividend yields were a sign that they were risky bets and that those dividends may soon be cut or go away completely as explained in the two quotes above the strategy being outlined is not a dividend growth strategy so i would not recommend following a dividend growth strategy based exclusively on this article s headline and in any case the base year 2009 is not exactly a typical year i really

{"tweets": ["I am talking about beta weighting a portfolio the post i used shows tos as an example which is a great use of the desktop tool i can enter spy as a ticker then see my delta of each position in relation to spy as a portfolio i seek a beta of 0 which means I am perfectly uncorrelated to the movement as the market as a whole according to historical trading patterns how beta works is it is a measurement of historical correlation to another tickerunderlying when used alone it is typically meant to the s amp p 500 benchmark or the us total stock market as a whole you can beta weight to anything amd for example has a beta of 3 to the s amp p 500 so with everything else unchanged if the s amp p 500 increases by 1 amd is expected to increase by 3 in other words owning 100 shares of amd at 46 a share 4600 is like owning 13800 of spy 3x 4600 then alpha is the excessive return over the market so say my portfolio has an alpha of 3 vs the s amp p 500 then if the s amp p increases by 1 then my portfolio should increase by 4 if the s amp p 500 increases by 10 then my portfolio should increase by 13 alpha can only really be reliably obtained from a long short portfolio actually making bets and being correct about it a lot of investors mistake alpha for high beta portfolios say you were 100 in amd and spy increased by 10 and your portfolio increased by 30 novice investors say they have a 20 alpha when in reality all their gains are from beta my portfolio seeks to profit from alpha and theta plays i like to long stocks i have a strong feeling forshow strong fundamentalsetc then ontop of this i like to sell call spreads and put spreadsnaked puts on other underlying individual stocks sometimes outright buy callsputs i never sell short imagine if i shorted tesla at 330 and it jumped to 420 i sell spreads pretty wide so the downside protection is a true hedge and does not cut much into gains so I would say be protected in a move that goes more than say 15 standard deviations i try to collect large premiums from the spreads say 13 or more so if it is a loser I will break even selling 23 more now beta is not bad it is a great way to use leverage without borrowing moneyetc if you make a high beta of 34x stocks in different markets mathematically it is like levering at 34x without risk of debt or calls expiring at 0 and realizing losses however that sort of portfolio has huge drawdown risks if the market itself declines 20 a 3x beta portfolio will have a 60 drawdown you definitely can get leverage decay in such a portfolio typically high beta stocks are growth stocks and so if they do not meet their growth expectations it could change quickly keep in mind beta is historical a 3 beta stock could become a 05 or 025 beta stock if they go bankrupt targeting a portfolio beta of 1 is fine too it should theoretically have the same return and risk as the market as a whole my portfolio goals are different I would like to get a high of a sharpe ratio as possible and consistent high returns year after year no matter what the market does say after inflation 100 equities returns 7 then I am hoping i could get 715 at much less risk I would rather have 15 every year no matter if the market drops 30 or increases 30 as over a long time 15 gt 7 if that portfolio has low volatility then you can lever the fuck out of it with portfolio margin loans etc as there is not much risk of having to pay back said loans i try to make pair trades when it is possible say if i favor amd then I will short intc selling call spreadsbuying puts in an equal amount to make amd intc 0 beta coincidentally this is different from a regular pairs trade that would add equal money to each position if intc is 10 beta and amd is 30 beta then I am shorting 3x the dollar amount on intc to beta weight sometimes i do not find a good pair like that example with industries being more and more mixed for example you could say short nvda and intc to do amd but it is hard as i think nvda gt amd when it comes to gpus but amd gt intc when it comes to future processors so some other sources of alpha is doing it on a sector basis for example right now I am long on tech and pharma and short financials as i see all this high debt borrowing for stock buybacks having issues with decreasing interest rates squeezing financial companies even more with how multiple companies overlap these days I am finding sector bets to have a good return right now so a sector bet may look like long amd long nvda short intc long sgen long gild short immu then short bac long jpm and weight sectors in how much i want to weightbet on sectors and adjust positions so the portfolio as a whole 0 beta", "thank you for posting that wow its like why would i buy aobc or ccj any more

account down something like 93 all time today I am at 104 and perspectively that is a 350 increase in the last 2 months however I am still down like 60 or so all time so pick your half glass of milk strangely i had an easier time earning money when i was at 30 than right now i was not afraid of losing 30 so i made yolo plays on stocks that i did my dd on getting 20 off of f s last earnings call

shot up to 317 the one that shot me over was mu s earning call last week those are my profitable trades if i had not made some losses in between I would be closer to 200 and if i had held that first spy option I would be closer to 400 but i do not cry over gains now that I am at 100 I am nervous I have been making money instead of losing it and now I am too cautious to make any plays because I am aware there has been a level of luck to my last few trades I am probably just going to dump some money into my account and learn about selling covered calls instead of putting in debit spreads might

than 5 of my total account balance to a single position buy in immediately after the iv crush following earnings and sell immediately before the next earnings event takes place i also only buy when the current trend moves at a faster rate when compared to delta than the theta does for example when i bought in pg had increased 44 over the last 52 weeks and the calls i bought had a delta of 04 with a theta of 004 the weekly expected move then is 0846 i bought in when it was around 113 and the target sell date is 1021 i can then predict that if the current trend continues obviously the big risk here it would increase by a little less than 1 per week that would mean i could expect an increase in contract price by around 004 delta 002 theta 002 per week all else unchanged and gamma will continue to increase the delta gains plus i intended to capture vega gains by buying when iv is low and selling when iv is high seemed like a solid plan on paper unfortunately i do not know how solid it is in practice at least not the earningsbased rule iv has up to this point remained largely unchanged i still have 2 weeks until my sell date but I am thinking i missed my optimal sell chance when it was up 500 it is currently around 200 because the market shit itself the past two weeks all that to say i think the premise is good but rather than set a specific date and hold until that date i should have set a target gain or target price per contract i think it definitely can be profitable i should mention that the only real proven way to consistently make money with options that I am

do quite well do you think they are going to be the winner or close enough to make growth almost certain anyway it is currently well above its historical valuation metrics so a little too pricey for me unless they are the market winner amd I am rooting for them but I am not buying them too pricey a lot has to go right for a very long time in order to justify the current valuation intc they have got a fair number of probably shorttomidterm issues it is currently cheap relative to its historical metrics but there are good reasons why I would buy them at a 50 discount to where they are today they will be around for the longhaul but i do not see a lot of growth they are probably fairly priced maybe even a little underpriced right now but i do not tend to buy things when they are fairly priced i like to buy at a discount msft is a great company but it is running into the law of big numbers so its growth will almost certainly slow again it is fairly priced i own it but that is because i bought it 10 years ago and am just holding t is not my favorite lots of debt pretty big market cap that said it is got a good dividend and an activist investor who has some potential for improvement

service fee is a race to the bottom and will approach zero in due time you can approach that as a positive or a negative given slower growth is offset by higher barriers to entry as it raises the bar for minimal scale to participate i would not be surprised if at some point large hsa providers need to pay for the privilege to manage large enterprise accounts I would imagine at that point though we have hit a large inflection in the scurve and multiple winners will have surfaced at the end of the day this is an enterprise driven decision and so the decision to participate is made at executive levels the 34 fee exists among all top 3 united webster hsa so is not unique fidelity probably puts increased pressure to progress this down to zero but there is a reason why the major banks and sold their hsa businesses jpm to webster etc it is a much more complicated business to service from our diligence if all it were was who has the lowest cost of capital the big banks would all have stayed and been defacto winners there probably is not a huge difference between any of the hsa providers there also is not a huge difference between checkings accounts between wells bac or jpm but accounts are still really sticky and roes are quite attractive for a commodity business but we thought he was more uniquely positioned as they have been winning market share and use an internally developed

mature after 2066 but may convert to a floating rate from then until 2086 it can be called back by boaml for 25 per share current price 2644 which becomes more likely as the price goes up since it means they can refinance with a lower rate you would lose some money if that happened preferred stock dividends can often be taxed like qualified stock dividends the price looks stable now but it can

completely honest the major cornerstone of their business is real estate this is also unrelated to canned soda ketchup and ice cream but it is altogether the most simplest investment vehicle that anyone can understand it is so easy even donald trump could not mess it up despite his valiant efforts to do so so excuse me for not listing every company under berkshire s conglomerate umbrella but the entire point of this thread is about buffet s inability to invest correctly in the tech sector insurance and finance ie wfgeicolibertymutualetc are technical in the way they operate but they are not the type of tech companies anybody in this thread is talking about the tech industry is fast paced and thus traditional investors like buffet who thrive off of brandindustry moats simply can not stomach the risk that even multibillion dollar companies can be left behindstagnant if they are not constantly adapting well and staying competitive much like his failed 2011 investment ibm that none of the buffet fans seem to want to address also the leadership required to run cocacola is not the same leadership required to run facebook buffet can not pin that down because he is inherently distrustful of tech ceos that make bold claims honestly i do not even blame him because half these dudes sound like con artists like elon that just might be geniuses like nadella the majority of buffet s success is in the past when investing was simpler has earned him and his company a bit of a moat themselves and that is something he always acknowledges berkshire is offered deals much like bac that are not available to most retail investors ie convertible notes warrants preferred shares etc that is good for him and berkshire but retail investors who idolize his judgment and follow his advertised stock picks are quite stupid you are not getting the same deal he is that is a fact anyway the fact of the matter is it is 2019 you have to be invested in the tech industry today or at least paying attention to it because it is rippling across all industries i do not really care what he is done in the past when i see his company investing more and more in apple that makes me think apple might be overvalued buffet sees a moat that he thinks justifies a multibillion dollar investment what he does not understand is that moats in the tech industry do not last for long unless they are maintained maybe even for a company as big as apple it is not like cocacola having to worry about rc cola becoming relevant or making a new energy drink which is how buffet understands it kobe bryant is a retired nba player he was in all regards a phenomenal player and is widely regarded as one of the alltime greats there are legitimate criticisms of kobe bryant s game but bryant s online fanbase is legendary for their inability to let anyone criticize kobe without being needlessly and rudely criticized kobe stans are real and stupid just like buffet stans are very real and very stupid

38 and you end up holding 2 you want to generate income do not use a growth stock for this eg sq amd i recommend one of the banks like bac look in the option chain and pick the strike that has the most extrinsic value expiring 1 month out i try to collect at least 060 otherwise it is not really worth the fees and commission then set a limit order to roll that call out to the next month for a credit to get an idea of how much you should collect in credit each month for the roll plot the calendar spread on thinkorswim like this here i look at the 29 call calendar between march and april you can see the amount of credit slowly rising as it gets closer to expiration this chart tells me that you can easily collect 065 to 070 for the month on each call if that rolling order does not execute by the expiration date you should manually roll it if the stock drops to the point where you can not collect at least 050 per month on covered calls just hold and collect the dividend", "I am an idiot

which is impossible to know for sure since you can not go back in time and try this is not a meaningless topic especially when you are trying to educate others and feeding them incorrect information that could cost them money if they tried to do the same thing as you to your point jcp and bac are completely different stocks than bioc bioc is a junk penny stock that trades like 500k shares a day i could move the stock myself with a minuscule 25k pattern day trading account by just market ordering 2030k shares I have personally done this deliberately using loose marketable limit orders eg stock is at 099 10k shares on the offer i send a limit order for 25k shares with a limit at 103 and fill the majority above 100 in order to kick thin stocks like this through a key level into a breakout and start a frenzy to sell into jcp and bac on the other hand trade tens of millions of shares a day on average you are not going to have the same problem on a stock like bac or jcp because they are actively traded by major hedge funds institutional traders and hft firms which add massive amounts of liquidity and also hide orders on level 2 something you can not do with schwab or tos which is why i suggested using a better broker anyway if you market order 20k shares of jcp again which I have personally done you will fill it all within a couple pennies most of the time you will fill below the ask I would still use a marketable limit order because i prefer to guarantee the amount of slippage I will allow but stocks like bac and jcp usually have tons of shares available that are not even shown on level 2 especially at key levels since big sellers do not want to give away the fact that they are dumping 500k shares at a time likewise if you use more professional trading software tradestation das etc you can create orders that will automatically cancel after certain thresholds are hit timebased pricebased fillbased etc so to give you an example of how a trader even as a lowly retail trader could screw someone such as yourself let us just assume that it were this trader sitting there with 20k shares on the offer of bioc let us assume that they are using a 100k pattern day trading account and that they actually own 75k shares of bioc in their strategy they place 5 orders 20k at 101 1k at 102 1k at 103 1k at 104 and 51k at 105 the 51k order at 105 is set to display only 1k shares there so as not to scare people hiding order size is a very basic thing for anyone who trades heavily and it is not illegal now let us assume that using tradestation this trader has created a strategy using tradestation s easylanguage look it up this is a real thing or maybe check out ralgotrading for more possibilities that will automatically cancel certain orders once they fill a certain number of shares again this is not illegal just a simple algorithmic order automation strategy retail traders can easily design to make trades based on different criteria without them actually being there now along comes you with your market order for 5k shares you send your order because you see 20k on the offer and think it is guaranteed you will be filled at 101 immediately the algo picks up that you are buying the 20k block at 101 you fill 100 shares and the 20k order gets cancelled leaving 1k at 102 which then fills 100 shares and also gets cancelled the same happens to the 103 and 104 orders now you have got 400 shares at a 1025 average and 4600 left to fill with a market order and there is a 51k block at 105 you get the remaining 4600 shares of your order at 105 of course this assume no other market participants which is obviously a ridiculous assumption but remember that this is what can be done with very basic professional day trading software and a simple algorithm by a retail trader with a small 100k account now imagine what an institution or a hedge fund or even a large individual trader with say a 1m account could do anyway I am rambling now but yeah using market orders is very dangerous you should use marketable limit orders in your case it would have guaranteed you a fill and limited your slippage by the way if you look at the active trader tab in tos you will see buttons for buy ask and sell bid those are marketable limit orders so it is not like it is rocket science lol anyone who is reading this please do not use market orders unless you are doing so for a specific reason and you know what you are doing a marketable limit order will guarantee you an instant fill of whatever supply is there and protect you from slippage at the same time hope this helps without sounding too much like a dick", "i will stick to the way i trade because it works you are reading too much into it and i really do not want to waste time going back and forth on a meaningless topic so let me break it down for you real quick there are certain stocks out there that as the stock moves up and down both the bid and the ask have a ton of shares sitting bac is a great example of that go look at level 2 on bac for a few mins one day the trade i had in bioc is the exact same way i guarantee you that if i had submitted a market order the ask would not have all of a sudden disappeared and i would have filled at 110 or some other ridiculous thing you said also when i did trade jcp this week with a market order it was the same thing i encourage you to take a few minutes this morning after the market opens and look at the bidask on both bioc and jcp and try to tell me I am wrong again thanks for the concern but i know what i am doing thinkorswim is a solid platform and I am not going to go market buy something and then magically all the sellers disappear and i fill 10 higher than i intended because i understand level 2 order flow time and sales and

customers and sellers i also like how they are expanding their offerings such as cash app or mainly their lending service where they can utilize all the data they have and believe me they have a ton and I am sure they will find multiple ways to use it honestly i also would not be surprised to see them bought out by someone big in a few years that is part of the appeal to me and honestly i like having at least a few growth stocks along the value ones but i definitely understand your argument i definitely agree with both bac and jpm though and as i said earlier my likely next step is buying more into these possibly both i like apple s valuation too as i firmly believe they are one of the strongest brands to have ever existed there is more to it and I have discussed this stock in the last

replicate overall i like the company and the growth trajectory they are on but that is exclusive from the value it presents as an investment at this point in time you are paying a hefty premium without a dividend too for a stock which appears overvalued by all conventional and rational metrics on a side note i like the valuation of bac and jpm at this point which looks quite undervalued for

traded today was at 171 so at some point this position was worth almost 30k rip whoever bought them at 171 most people here trade options because they require lower capital investment to exercise

explaining why i really do not understand options that well but I would like a bit of clarity if you can help from what i understand by looking at this op bought 200 contracts 022 per to buy shares of bac 2722 which i get is 44 so basically one contract is worth 100 shares to get the 4400 so if the share price of bac is above 2722 at any time op can execute this option and then sell his shares but if the share price is below 2722 until 118 and then close still under then op has the option but basically has to let it expire and not buy the shares but still has to pay for the contracts regardless i see that the price he sold at is 2809 which minus the 2722 he bought them per contracts at is 87 times the 20000 shares represented by the total contracts which is 17400 so I am guessing there is

biggest fan of bac personally but i think it is valued pretty fairly right now have not done a ton of research on them particularly and as silly as it sounds i hate them from a excustomer standpoint so never really looked too deep in them they just sort of seem to exist and struggle with innovating i know banks are not exactly renowned for being innovative but bac just seems stuck from where they were 57 years ago whereas banks like jpm and ally have made solid attempts at bringing something new to the table not a bad company just not sure you will be outperforming a simple index fund with a company like bac as for banks or just financials in general that i like i always liked berkshire hathaway and jp morgan and think they are valued decently right now goldman sachs has taken a pretty nasty beating over the past six months I am not as confident in them in the short term but think an argument can be made that they are near their bottom morgan stanley is in a similar boat as well these two are not going anywhere but i worry how they would fare during a recession or economic slowdown as a lot of their business involves investment banking i hold wells fargo but i got in a few years ago with them and have not really looked things over in quite some time tbh it is just a small position I have held for awhile and just sort of let be hoping they can actually turn things around from a business and culture point and have a scandal free solid decade in the 2020s i do not intend on adding to my position with them and would not really recommend them they have a lot of work to do and the scandals despite damaging their reputation did not exactly kill their stock and put them at bargain prices i think deutsche bank could be a real wildcard they are in really tough shape right now and things look pretty grim but they are also one of the largest banks in the world and especially in europe it could be a risky play that pays off very well i can not see them collapsing or being allowed to fall too hard simply because of their size influence and connections to so much of europe as mentioned i also own shares of visa and square as well i know they are not banks but figured I would mention them as they are within the financial sector love visa and it is actually my biggest single stock holding square i got really lucky with and purchased shares a little under 2 years ago sold some of my position in september but still hold a few thousand dollars in them i think both companies have pretty bright futures but not sure if they are exactly bargains or fairly valued right now banks are really tricky to evaluate and the metrics used to value them are a little different than stocks in other sectors based on the current climate I would be cautious of any bank that relies heavily on investing or broker services banks relying heavily on mortgages and real estate may be at risk too i think the ones likely to succeed over the next few years are the ones valued modestly that are diversified enough in their business models and can remain innovative in a fairly stagnate sector i also think insurance has solid potential", "sheeit I am getting on that n bac has been my

continue buying until i have doubled my holdings or my average cost hits 350 i believe that it would be reasonable for this stock to hit 500 per share in the next year or two so far i have experienced a 1805 loss bkep 1591 average cost 158 i am not optimistic for this stock i think realistically this stock could hit 180 per share in the next year or two i am debating if i should continue buying until i double my holdings in order to push my average cost down i would not continue buying once it hits 125 per share and beyond i have experienced a 2975 loss with this stock siri 2756 average cost 606 do not expect much appreciation if stock hits 700 per share i would jump ship and wait for it to dip back down to under 650 i mostly want the dividends i will continue buying until i at least double my holdings as long as average cost stay under 650 i have so far experienced a 927 loss bac 2849 average cost 2522 do not expect much appreciation but i think it would be reasonable for stock to hit 28 in the next year or two not sure if i would sell at that point if it hits 30 without any new developments then i would sell mostly holding for the dividends 1011 lost here i am looking to

economic slow down bac was not going up even when beating all predictions for earnings unemployment is bottoming out while really low unemployment sounds good it is also a precursor of a recession in 12 years if companies can not hire people to fill their roles it requires them to give higher salaries to get people to come to them this leads to inflation also companies struggle to maintain growth when they can not hire anyone to grow it really seems like a lot of companies are hitting peak earnings a lot of companies guided down for next year during their earnings this past season that is a lot of why so many stocks crashed even though they beat estimates this past season also the auto industry is kind of slowing down sales are down slightly and i take gms layoff more as them also

marginperformance it should show you how this trade will impact your margin my guess is that on a cash account you are going to see the available margin decrease by the full value of the bond whereas on a margin account it only decreases by 1 or whatever it is for the bond you are using less than 6 months until maturity is 1 keep in mind that while 99 of a lt 6 month tbill can be used as margin collateral it still reduces your available cash by the full amount of the bond so take as an example you have 100k and buy 100k in bonds you now have 99k margin available for options but your cash balance is now 0 if you buy 10k of stock you are now using 10k margin loan so any interest benefit you may have received from the bond interest is negated by the margin loan using bonds is more for when you are tying up margin as part of a short option position it does not help for purchasing stock this is where the basic explanation of margin margin loan falls apart there is more to it and those extra details matter in this kind of scenario regarding bond etf I am pretty sure it needs to be actual bonds not a fund of any sort again you could call them to ask but I am pretty sure it has to be actual bonds regarding getting your shares called in your trading permissions enable t1 algorithmic trading venue this effectively allows you to buysell stock with t1 settlement to satisfy option assignment without losing your original stock lot from a tax perspective this way if you do get assigned you can basically make a new purchase to satisfy the assignment and keep your original tax lot i generally do not like to comment on what i think about doing a strategy on a specific stock ie bacamd however selling a put is a fine way to buy a stock at a discount but if the stock never drops to your put and just keeps going up then you only get the premium of the put and lose out on the upside of the stock if you are planning to buy anyway you could also consider buying an itm put at the same delta if you were planning on buying at a discount anyway if the stock drops this gets you roughly the same premium if you use the same delta and allows you to capture more of the upside ie stock at 100 and you want to sell a 95 strike put also consider how a 105 strike put would perform under various conditions the extrinsic will be roughly the same but you are able to capture upside movement of the underlying with the 105 strike you may think well what if the stock drops yeah the 95 strike allows the stock to drop 5 before you lose pros and cons if you want to own the stock soon at a discount itm put gets you there and allows to capture upside movement but has no downside protection whereas the otm put has a little bit of downside protection I am not suggesting one is better than the other it is up to what you think of the underlying and under what conditions you would have bought want to capture upside movement and having said all of this the risk free rate is part of the option premium so depending on what you are trying to achieve it may or may not be worth messing with the bonds you also need to consider bond commissions and finally when dealing with bonds there is certain minimum cash thresholds or you get a worse price what i mean is the ask might be effectively 18 interest on 5k of bonds but 20 interest on 25k in other words the way the bond market works is you sort of get a worse ask price which translates to a worse interest rate if the size you are trading is too small you also risk partial executions and still have to pay the commission ie if the ask is 12k 18 and you try to buy 7k you may get a partial execution of 1k and have 6k go unfilled I am pointing this out because of your implications that you may not have enough capital to meet the

it will because the company to fail so if f is down to 7 but you bought at 12 and nothing has changed their sales are still good and everything else then just buy more at 7 but if f comes out and says

whenever you get your paycheck save as much as you can of it and use it to buy more shares of the s amp p do not sell or liquidate your position simply hold it as that will let you garner the benefits

supposed to be less risky than trading naked options all together", "for example if i look at bac credit spreads for sept 7 for every possible dollar of profit I would need 49 in collateral seems

financial companies in 2009 as extreme examples of one time events tobacco companies after government placed bigger taxes is an example of uncertain future department stores are an example of declining business the sectors had reason to be down but they were not long term and many companies in the sector had great business these out of favor distressed areas is where you will usually and

they basically bought stock at the very bottom in 2008 preventing these companies from going bust and look at the growth since then buy low sell high literally there is no question the bailout was profitable for the taxpayers the only debate is on exactly how profitable gt in middecember when the treasury unloaded its final shares of ally financial its last major troubled asset relief program tarp holding and declared the books more or less closed it said that yous taxpayers had made 156 billion that touched off a debate about what that 156 billion bailout profit meant gt but you know what by my math that 156 billion is only about 125 of the profit that taxpayers have realized on the bailout that is because tarp was only a minor part of the resources that the government committed to the bailout gt the actual taxpayer profit on the bailout is about 350 billion by my math that is right 350 billion all in cash most of which has held down the federal budget deficit over the past six years gt in total 11 companies received at least 10 billion in bailouts from the government during the financial crisis however the government was not simply lending money to these companies it was investing in them by taking ownership stakes in most cases the government was essentially buying shares of stock much like ordinary investors do in their trading accounts gt for the most part the government was later able to sell those shares of stock for a large profit in the years that followed in fact the government took a loss on only two of its 25 largest bailouts gt mortgage aggregators fannie mae and freddie mac were the two largest financial crisis bailouts together fannie and freddie received nearly 190 billion in bailout funds however the government has now netted more than 68 billion in profit from the investment both companies trade on overthecounter markets gt taxpayers also made a killing on the vast majority of bank bailouts as well the government turned a profit of more than 134 billion on its citigroup ticker c bailout it also added 5 billion in profit from the american international group aig bailout 45 billion from the bank of america corp bac bailout and 3 billion from the gmac bailout gt of course not all the bailouts worked out quite as well taxpayers lost 113 billion on the 507 billion general motors co gm bailout other investments such as the 34 billion ocwen financial corp ocn bailout the 1 billion select portfolio servicing bailout and the 973 million nationstar mortgage holdings nsm bailout ended up total taxpayer losses gt still one thing seems clear taxpayers came out ahead in total 623 billion in taxpayer money was dispersed via bailouts and roughly 698 billion has come back via dividend revenue interest fees and asset sales it does not take a math genius to see the bailouts ultimately earned taxpayers more than 75 billion in profit and that number is still growing", "hello 48 yo been at this for about 18 months goal is to grow

be nice for a solid income stream they have to be paid in full as long as the common stock is issuing dividends so they should be fairly secure as long as the underlying business is sound here is a

lot of discount they did not suspend divs during the financial crisis some of the financials have good preferreds such as bac and wfc but generally they are at a bit of a premium and most did suspend divs during the financial crisis about a year or two on average companies do have to reinstate preferred divs before common divs the divs on psa and frt are cumulative which means the missed payments would have to be made before the common stock can start issuing dividends again so you eventually get your money most financials do not have cumulative preferreds so those missed payments are history

give myself a safety net in all i think that you do not need 500 returns a year to make a lot of money you just need to consistently perform average or a little better than average i bought bac several months ago i sold a week or two ago but i bought back in today at 3095 as far as the deafness it was idiopathic hearing loss i got really sick when i was a junior in high school and the next morning i woke up deaf unfortunately there is not much that can be done it happens to one out of every couple hundred thousand people it sucks but i went to bed a normal able bodied guy with two ears and woke up the next morning deaf it really sucks and its definitely been something that i still struggle to get over but it keeps a man thirsty lol as far as the studying goes it really depends i do not use flashcards because they take way too long for me to make and honestly the amount of material is absurd we take around 44 credits per semester for the first 2 years of med school so i go home and read the book and i try to make study guides while the professors lecture I am doing okay but obviously its pretty impossible to know it all its like drinking out of a fire hose lmao i am really motivated right now and you kind of have to just be disciplined and study i said 80 hours but that is including school time as well so i guess it is not a true 11 hours per day tbh but that is awesome
