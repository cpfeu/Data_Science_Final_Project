to more trading it does not mean the 10x volume is properly allocated between the firms the better technical and quantitative firm will get a much larger portion of that and the rest that is given to the secondary players may not necessary be the best flow consider options for example virtu does not really do options they do more like equities and etfs but i know options a bit better since i did my internship at sig susquehanna back in the day so the two dominant players are sig and citadel when rh came along and got more retail flow the flow was essentially all sold to these two firms like if you are a new firm trying to break in you got nothing you would get the crumbs these two top firms did not want and obviously if they did not want it it was not that good of flow this is the main issue with virtu imo it is a good firm it will benefit from volatility it will benefit from volume it will benefit from wider bidask it will benefit from more retail flow but it is strictly dominated in the space by huge players like citadel in equities or jane street in etfs and that is something that can stunt its long term growth betting on virtu is in a way betting against citadel if that

you understand the magnitude of that number 17 of apples 265 billion revenue from services annually is over twice what netflix s revenue in 2019 the us market is fairly saturated but people will continue to buy new iphones and pay for monthly services the growth potential world wide is huge though apple will continue to make their process more proprietary bye bye intel and continue to increase their margins and sales growth in the past 20 years there has only been a few year where the annual revenue fell i do not think most people that buy apple buy it for a growth stock option

overestimating the chance that this will happen and people do not want to pay carry on the short shares to see it out always a possibility but seems unlikely to me there are three parties that generally need to consent to a ma deal the board the shareholders and the regulators we already know the regulators and boards are not an issue all that remains is the shareholders both companies have large institutional share holders early money pe and etfs for the most part both companies also have representatives of these institutions on their boards in fact pe guys that will bring significant voting power facilitated the deal in the first place i think there is a slim chance that the deal falls apart but obviously i could be wrong gt also if the deal falls through and teledoc increases you have a lot of downside risk no correct however by far and away the pressure has been on lvgo and not tdoc to reject the deal lvgo also reported a blowout quarter the same day this deal was announced if the deal gets rejected a big chunk of share price action is going to depend on which party does the rejecting and right now i can say with absolute certainty that it is the lvgo shareholders that are unhappier of the two secondly lvgo is also growing faster and their runway to their tam is a lot larger than where tdoc is at this point at the end of the day though both companies are going to take a hit if the deal is called off because management has been so emphatic that they will become competitors if they do not merge that is also partly why i think shareholders may grumble but the deal gets done anyway gt i think the very price drift we see between the shares should essentially be capturing the risk of the deal not going through your thesis is it overstates the risk is that essentially true yes but it is more than that do not believe that the market is perfect there have been numerous instances that even futures markets throw up huge arbitrages that do not get filled in immediately if you trade bonds you will see slight inversions in sovereign em debt all the time purely because of technical factors such as liquidity at times also keep in mind that for a big chunk of institutions they are going to be forced into analyzing the deal for a while before they can act so a lot of times especially for smaller companies such as these you are going to see large institutions go neutral just hold their positions and not buysell until they finish a full review and so a lot of the trading that is going on right now is retail led m amp a arb funds are not the power they once were i think 45 years ago any number of arb hedge funds would have closed this gap a lot quicker having said all that the arb did get cut almost in 12 through the day as of close all that is available is 38 at one point during the day it was 78 gt with a 7 return you have room to further hedge against the deal falling through and teledoc mooning by buying options i suppose would you recommend this for someone who approaches this kind of thing pretty systematically in addition to my short tdoc and long lvgo position i also have call options in tdoc that is as you mentioned for hedging purposes but also for directional purposes in that i believe the merits of the deal will come through additionally the latter half of last week was just terrible for smallmidcap growth companies a lot of that was idiosyncratic but there was certainly a rotation out of tech after both gs and jpm came out and said now s a good time to rotate into cyclicals because of vaccine hopes i

retarded spike yesterday at 350pm they bought about 600 contracts hence the retarded spike but right after uvxy tvix and the rest of the long vol funds came in and bought a fuckton of vix futures which dunked everything back down uvxy holding contracts 62 exposure 62 contracts 63 exposure 63 cboe vix future jul20 12776 383599400 16509 479999175 cboe vix future jun20 14196 400682100 14855

futures weight shifting from june futures towards july futures and this motherfuckers is very important it is important due to its effects on the vix as vix futures get bought the short side will be hedging them via short spx exposure the vix is calculated from spx options with more than 23 days and less than 37 days to expiration see that means june vix futures are hedged via spx june short positioning which is also reflected in the options but starting with 527 those 619 positions that hedge vix jun futures slip out of the calculation for the vix itself hence vol started shredding at that point just for this stupidass reason so now money is finally pouring back into long volatility and vix etfs started rolling to the july futures this means that july spx will be hammered down and those expirations are included in the vix calculation which is going to move the vix higher and the market lower and guess what we are also in a short squeeze on volatility tvix amp uvxy short fees are over 5 and almost no shortable shares available anymore on top of that all these garbageass long leveraged etfs have to start rolling those june nq futures soon and they are not going to be able to roll those huge amounts in this dogshit liquidity gt tqqqpocalypse again short interest on tqqq is going up big as well see expiration and roll dates so what you want to do is this dump everygoddamnlong except long volatility long vix 77 amp 721 calls 60 strike long tqqq way otm puts for every god damn expiration from 612 to 721 if ya played the akimbo close the put spreads should be a 23x right now ride the other positions for free for the love of god if you do not want to go short at least move to cash you can move back in after the 1st week of july if market s still intact but

accounting for the auto loans they took on from fidelity bank of the james is a small commercial bank in lynchburg va that does a lot of business in the growing charlottesville and appomattox areas a quiet hunch has me wondering if they do a lot of lending to liberty university because they are one of the largest colleges in their area silvergate bank over in ca accepts cryptocurrencies into their noninterest bearing deposits and only have a handful of locations there is cheaper banks out there but realistically speaking how much of a return can i expect from those investments i can see silvergate being bought out by a larger player that wants to get into crypto lending i know gs is doing it but bac and wfc have sworn away from it if it becomes profitable then i can see them being acquired i do not understand acquisition accounting so i have to stay away from ameris bank and since they had an internal failure in their financial controls i can not necessarily trust that is the only one they will ever have since I am not smart enough yet to figure out acquisition accounting bank of the james does not have enough business in their area so when their value is going to be

went that well we would not see 14m people filing initial claims for unemployment on july 30th another thing to say about the fed they are just artificially reducing the supply due to their qe program and fixed schedule they can further contract the supply of they do more qe but they can not control the demand the funny thing is that while the fed and other people are scared of a massselling of us treasuries we have seen treasury yields only going down for a couple of weeks now despite the fed not changing anything regarding qe for months just the 120 billion per month powell has mentioned so

got wiped out if it was not for a well timed gs put", "some sort of bearish bet on shop either through an otm put i do not see why you would do this with your amount of capital or a put spread yes i know that this stock has been bulletproof so far and you might loose a lot of money but similarly enough you have a better than a 1 in 3 imo opinion of making very big bucks here is my reasoning 1shopify is all about guidance this stock is priced to be an avalanche that means that it must keep delivering 40 revenue growth must deliver very good guidance and the key is that the gmv needs to be at least 25 billion dollars gmv is like the holy grail of shop right now measures how much shit people sell there now i think that they will beat but i do not expect good guidance why quite simply it sucks to be an entrepreneur right now shop is extremely levered to the condition of small businesses and i do not think that they are doing so well right now the simple reason for that is these small entrepreneurs are usually selling nonessential stuff that is the first to be cut on tight budgets and i expect this to kind of diminish shop saw a large influx of those but i expect these to start slowing down as people realise that selling shit rn is really hard 2changing business modelshopify has started to vertically integrate itself meaning that they want to handle all the aspects of small online business warehousing delivery etc this is a great move for the long term as they are essentially mimicking what amazon is doing over in the yous but the problem is that its quite a lot of cash that is being committed to building out the enterprise when the economic outlook is so uncertain those things add operational complexity to a company where i am not yet sure that they completely figured out their core offering lots of things where shop could improve and so i personally do not like it 3option pricing essentially this is more of an auxiliary reason current option pricing on shop for this week has an expected move of about 8 just buying the 1000 put weekly is 45 which would already put 8 in a profit zone this is of course not how option prices work in complete rigor since the move could unfold over many days but it tells you that shop options are vulnerable to shitty earnings with the 900 weekly put at about 10 you only need 890 to make profit which means that a miss and a tank tomorrow should already be something like 2x and i believe there is a better than a 1 in 3 chance of that happening also there are not a lot of options open for this week which is actually quite good for a dump since you will not get anally fucked by mm s burning theta the put side especially looks like a barren wasteland 3gs upgrade this is a meme reason but by the time gs gets to a play the play is already over see nflx earlier this year 670 pt fb 265pt and many other such cases conclusion basically this is the cheapest in relative terms way to play a shitty entrepreneur economy of course it is so cheap only because all of the bears of this stock have been wiped out with a meteor over the last few months however at some point somebody has to provide the bid on the put options and given the fact that this stock is priced to absolute perfection why not let it be you with your 200k i would say that the best way to play this one would be with a martingale strategy this is what i use for bubble stocks once the narrative dies down 1decide what of your capital you want to use to short i would personally not recommend anything over 5 on a play like this but let us say 200k for you 2 you go short today with something like 30k if it pays off you leave you either get otm puts sell a call spread buy a put spread etc just your standard options for 30k can either go next expiration date or the weeklies for extra autism but on weeklies i would only recommend something like 900910 puts and you will not get 30 k worth of those today 3 you wait it out for the next earnings at that point it will have either corrected in which case you stay off and leave with your 170k or you reshort this time you go short with 60k 4 repeat one more time with 120k to finish this is how i typically short anything that isextremely overvalued and that is how i will be shorting zoom for the next 3 quartersbasically i get to bail out if the earnings are really good and the fundamentals change but get to re short if i still think we are in a bubble yeah you might loose a lot of money but adjust your sizing to your prt and it is much better than shorting a bubble all at once or shorting with flat amounts lastly i will likely be downvoted to shit by shop bulls so you should question whether you will be inversing me or inversing them also why the fuck are you looking

shocking at all it is known gs has the best equities business and jpm has the best fixed income business they do not make money off of being smart this is not some citadel rentech or susquehanna they literally make most money off of commissions and more volumevolatility is more commissions", "I am actually surprised it sold off intraday to almost flat on the day i think the assumption is that the trading revenue is not permanent while i agree it will not be this high again since the volumevolatility will wane a bit the thing is with the fact now there are so many more retail traders trading can be considered a stay at home activity so if you are going to reward zoom for their stay at home prowess gs trading revenues has to benefit too going forward even if it is not at the same level as last quarter their other sectors should bounce back too once the economy opens up and we increase rates again gs and jpm are by far the two best bank stocks if you wanted to buy a bank stock these should be the only 2 options", "absolutely bought itm for that reason i believe it will see a jump similar to gs with their increased revenues from margin and trading commissions", "i can not believe gs had that type of earnings beat and sold off the trading revenue is not temporarily it will not be this high again but with more people now interested in trading you can consider it a more stay at home activity", "amazing the largest increases in new revenue are from the trade desks at jpm and gs the same banks trump is constantly promoting the ones they got to deal out most of the ppp loans I am sure their trading desks had no insider knowledge on a market that is been 90 driven by fed activity and news elon is right sec is an absolute joke", "this reminds me of hari something from gs and amd until last year he was probably still is such a piece of shit", "seems odd to me that this would be bid up when what we appear to be seeing is great trading results in a historically volatile market yes the quarter was great but do we think the markets will remain as volatile as its been in q2 for years to come if so then seems you would be worried about other macro issues which would impact gs prospects and if not then you would discount this quarter almost like an extraordinary item and not assume it will be replicated in the future in either case you would not be bidding the stock up because of this quarter s performance", "do not forget gs crush and remarkably good bank earnings", "anyone who thought gs beat in a real sense that it signals any bit of economic health probably also believes moderna constantly hyping a vaccine that does not in fact prevent you from getting the virus at all means anything gs beat due to trading revenue the oxford vaccine is the leading vaccine candidate by a mile and guess what it is university developed and they can not profit from it go long travel and stay out of this daily trash", "i do not care much for gs but my wfc

with gs yesterday and it was frustrating to me how little the market has responded to such great news", "basically what every bank and financials are offering and actually most companies in q2 we do not know what the future holds but we are positioned very strongly blah blah blah kind of stuff not a rockstar guidance but its fine however both quarters for gs during covid have been finegreat and the quarters prior to covid were finegreat like i said tho financials are all still holding onto the numbers that justify failure of business some have still have significant risk pnc reported 850 eps on consensus of 050 cents per share but failed to rally but this one makes a little more sense to me because their were some other concerns looking at numbers and guidance but gs stellar q2 crushed almost every number yoy limited risk proven to make money during covid dividend is safe etc", "that does not seem the case financials have been one of the worst performing sectors this year and they have not recovered to pre subprime levels the banks that do well are those that do not rely on traditional banking business like with gs", "retail bidder up gs in pm and got dumped on lol", "some big

either", "gs focuses solely on investing pretty much these are the banks that are doing well bc they have been able to recoup their losses and weather the dead times playing the game bac is more of

are not selling them so for example you are talking about buying a put on gs today right well today is wednesday instead of buying that put today you buy it on friday morning but it expires at the end of the day so you would need to sell to close before the end of the day it is risky but sometimes pays off", "are gs calls still viable I am very tempted in hopping in this tendy train", "literally

you 1 the ppp loans the jpm but especially bac are almost certainly making a killing there more loans processed in a quarter than multiple years combined 2 this is different from 08 in the sense that the banks were the bad guys then in this case they did not because the recession they have had 12 years of fed induced stress tests to prepare and they are the industry facilitating the fed s tools and getting paid well for it 3 the banks are going to understate how well they are doing partially because they do not want to look like the bad guys again this seemed to be the theme of the previous earning season when they allocated a ton of their capital to accommodate potential losses on loans i think they were intentionally overestimating the impact of covid and rightly so because that is their job always better to underpromise and overdeliver right we will see for sure this week 3 banks took an additional hit when buffett sold all of gs and some of the rest of his bank stocks but what was missed is that he sold some of his bank holdings to get his ownership just under 10 to avoid insider status and he likely sold all of gs because they are in the middle of expanding into consumer

in the meantime this presents the buy and hold investor with year ish opportunity 5 commercial real estate is hurting but residential is booming due to the low rates banks also make money on the underwriting 6 the fact that most banks came out of the stress test and did not cut dividends is hella bullish for me wfc is the exception but they have self inflicted wounds legal expenses due to their fake account scandale full disclosure i do not like wfc 7 a big reason banks do buybacks is because there is very few things they are allowed to do with money that changes with the repeal of the volcker rule lt lt this is slipping past a lot of people but it means that bank can now invest alongside their clients more risk but certainly more reward and I would rather they did then get back

really surprising given size but also cs and ubs had sizable holdings they are priced around 10 11 a share respectively they are contacts even 40 days out are under 1 ones with 714 to exp are around 006025 obviously the open interest is not great given the sizable position you could easily build up I am still generally bearish short term yeah yeah whatever gay bear but even if the market continues up next week the contracts are priced so cheap for a limited risk exposure anyways I will be picking some up of both given the healthy discount nature gt banks hold both sides of the swap obviously to hedge but are more exposed to volatility through rebalancing of both assets anyways I am not spending the rest of the weekend on here so happy 4th weekend to the americans from your european bro for the rest of you pubs are open soon so relax tldr ubscs are undervalued imo given they are holdings of leveraged equities swaps relative to size i see volatility picking up next week so puts on ubscs mid term exposure is limited given price of contracts either side so if market continues up it is limited risk"], "predictions": ["positive", "positive", "positive", "positive",

machine learning therefore their understanding should be the same which are models run in sequence or parallel which a voting mechanism is applied the thing you would hypothetically be identifying would be the top idea as to if this has been attempted before yeah check out sites like guru focus and whale wisdom and all those other 13f tracking sites also most of the sell side shops also publish top holdings of hedge fund managers gs comes to mind people have even created etf strategies following a similar methodology of cherry picking programatically from a list of supposedly top managers

sell out or a trader migh have a stop loss order going up and staying up is not volatility those are gains going up and down perpetually is volatility but yes you are also correct on the undervalued basis as well on the second point yes analyst may have more information but keep in mind we are not trading so we do not have an inherent advantage because we do not take positions as in monetary stake yes we have ratings that is why companies are willing to share more with us and i mean yeah clients of course get information but you also have access to some analyst research as well i know e

research is out there for you like yeah you will not find jpm or gs research but you can still get useful insights the other thing i would say to do that a lot of people do not is pay attention to who a companies largest shareholders are this is public there is a couple of things to look at here 1 the type of shareholders 2 when shareholders buy insell or increasedecrease stake type of shareholder is important because companies love to have long only firms investing in them for the long haul so if you look at a company and see it is investors are mostly hedge funds or ls funds or vol funds you know people are trying to make a quick buck off a swing trade more so than believing in the long term value of a company if a company has a lot of long only funds that means they believe in the long term business the second point is important because a company s investor relations is constantly in contact with its largest shareholders so if you see a large long only shareholder exit something they have been in for awhile probably a good reason to find out why good example of this is the other day pnc blackrocks largest stakeholder fully sold its stake if I am interesting in buying black

fucking flashing lights retail is usually fucking retarded and more often than not gets slaughtered you are completely discounting the very real risk that airlines go to bankruptcy and restructure honestly many of the airlines are way better off financially if they do this especially aal who has already done it once guess what happens to equity holders in bk and restructuring your scenario above assumes you picked one of the airlines that did not restructure and hit the start over button had you invested in american for example you would have watched your investment go to zero while the restructured company emerged from bankruptcy and shot up in reality you are falling victim to hindsight blinders you are looking at historical price graphs and dreaming of how you could have totally gotten in at the bottom and made mad tendies that is fine to dream about but fucking difficult to do in real life especially when bankruptcy is on the table now does that mean you should not yolo into airlines no if that is within your risk tolerance go for it but do not have blinders about the very real risk it goes to zero hedge your bet diversify into multiple airlines etc but acting like all in on aal is guaranteed tendies is fucking retarded not autistic that shit is not within brks risk tolerance however they invest in distressed companies that they know will not go bankrupt but the market thinks they will think gs post 2008 collapse no one wanted to touch wallstreet banks with a 10 pole but brk knew that shit was coming back eventually when time proves them right boom money brk pulling out tells you that their models say at least one of the airlines likely more than one is going to go tits up or at least return less than ideal for the foreseeable future are they right time will fucking tell to someone who has lived through several major crashes it is actually really disconcerting that brk is pulling out of so many positions they did not do that shit in the past so they think shit is going to hit the fan still you decide your destiny it is fine to bet against brk but just know there were retards before you that said the same things about airlines right before these shitty airlines went tits up in the past", "i thought wfcs risk was more residential than commercial gs is definitely commercial jpm is balanced", "so calls on gs got it", "would xlf also capture some of

abroad or transport it somewhere and you will encounter local regulations at every junction to transport it to unload it to move it to store it 2e most storage is in cushing and then at refineries themselves the refiners obvi store the crude before its processed into heating oil or unleaded gas then is the strategic petroleum reserve run by the us govt that is basically it there is some minor storage in the gulf around houston and some more near philly la and seattle I am sure you can google it 3 anyone can if your broker trader futures most do and you sign the disclosures you almost certainly can or anyone most speculators sign an agreement with their fcms stating that they can not take delivery and the broker has the right to close your position before delivery can occur i doubt as a retail trader you can ever take delivery of any commodity corn soy gold copper cattle hogs etc so its not just energies 3a cme globex is the electronic trading venue to buy and see cl contracts and any other cme product cme clearport is where you trade over the counter energy products and it handles the delivery mechanism for cl once it goes to delivery 3c i answered above but nymex is owned the cme globex and clearport are also owned by the cme 3d cl contracts uso is an eft fund that holds cl contracts and some cash and treasuries 3e cme is the parent company of all this uscf runs the fund uso which is an equity not a future contract and traded on stock exchanges and venues nyse you buy uso like you would buy spy or msft or aapl cl contracts are futures which is a different asset type 3f bony is the custodian for uso meaning they hold the actual assets on behalf of uso think it like bony is uso s broker 3g ice exchange has a wti contract as well this one can be cash settled unlike cl which is physically settled 3h if you can trade futures you can buy as many cl contracts as cash you have to cover margin 9800contract so if you have 100k you can buy 10 contracts there is no limit other then to cover your margin there are higher reportable limits but that is not for retail traders you would never get close to those limits if you are interested 3i they do not break down position holders by individual or institution but only by trader type this is covered for all futures contracts of any kind fx rates equities called the commitment of traders cot report and it comes

guaranteed investing strategy you can adopt you can guarantee saving on taxation though if you have not already then definitely check out the stocks amp shares isa this is effectively a tax free wrapper which you can deposit 20000 current limit into and keep free of capital gains and dividend taxation i believe vanguard has the cheapest fees below 25000 however if you plan on quickly depositing more than this then it is worth checking out fixed fee brokers who may turn out to be cheaper i went with iweb check out this site for a good breakdown I have seen recently that trading 212 offer a no commission isa so that might be worth looking into you have a 12300 tax free capital gains allowance above this you will pay 10 tax if your total taxable income total taxable gains are above basic income rate 20 if above and more if it is residential property you are selling dividend taxation begins at 2000 as above if your total taxable income and dividends are below basic rate then you pay 75 above it you pay rates of 325 up to 38 this is a bit of a kicker potentially hence the importance of the isa we also get a lovely stamp duty tax when buying individual uk shares at a rate of 05 on purchases over 1000 i believe there are no doubt many many more though understanding these will help you decide how to invest when buying foreign shares consider how they tax us if you are looking to invest in us shares then consider that they charge a 30 withholding tax on capital gains and dividends this can be reduced to 15 if a w8ben form is completed i believe within an isa i do not believe you can escape the 30 rate so consider this lastly your investing strategy is completely your own choice and you will find no strategy that is accepted by everyone that said a lot of evidence points to passive index funds performing better with purchases on regular intervals and a buy and hold strategy us equities have outperformed others for a long time though who knows if this will continue diversify keep costs low and understand why your investing what your risk tolerance is and what your goals are try putting a little bit little bit of money into the real market before you do anything big get a feel for how you cope if you want to get more actively involved read everything you can find and listen to every opinion on reddit lastly this is anecdotal but id personally

you look at those assets closer the extreme majority of them are in accounts recievable this part is a guess so tell me if I am wrong but i assume that is what their loans should pay over the course of the year should the loans stop being paid their amount of assets should nosedive even if they do not go bankrupt that huge change in the balance sheet should harm their valuation I have done some research about they way they do business and their model seems to rely on them being able to repossess cars quickly my understanding is that they write loans that are way higher than the liquid value of the car they are selling which depreciates over time and when they repo they take the borrower to court for the remaining balance and garnish wages that is shady business but it is very effective unless of course there are not any wages to garnish covid19 has cost everyone their job and the unemployment checks are not going to last long then what they can not pay off the entire balance of that loan by reselling the car because it is only worth a fraction of the loan s value the biggest monkey wrench for them is the new gaap provision that makes them note their expected loan losses that is going to absolutely slaughter their balance sheet this is not an accusation or financial advice everyone needs to look into this themselves but i suspect that cacc is not liquid and has not been for a good while i can see in their sec filings where they have been using spv s to package their loans and apparently sell them for cash whoever is beholding those loans once they default does not have a way to get their money back i also know that they are being investigated for breaching fiduciary duties source i see a lot of people that ask who is even holding this stock and where is the volume one

could also go for a few of the big sexy companies like jpm msft aapl or wm to get some blue chip in there other are right it is hard to invest with small amounts you will figure out why the hard way but basically you can not trade as much or as frequently and 5 of 500 is not a load of money but I am not an asshole like all these fucks you can still do it no problem there is only one important key contributions put in 100 once or twice a month make sure you can afford to put money into an ira or your 401 k first do not bet your own retirement hire professionals by investing in etfs and mutual funds second priority should be a savings account for emergencies about 3 months income then with the cash you use for beer and netflix buy stocks that way if you lose all your fucking money you will not get all butt hurt because your still okay financially if you invest 500 one time you will never see anything spectacular happen and to these other fuckwads if they invest all their gs and never contribute they will never see real gains either you got to add to it to speed up the compound effect so start with your 500 give yourself a month or maybe two to figure out how things work then start adding 100 once or twice a month or whatever you can afford out of your beer money and watch your little nest egg grow I have doubled my money since mid march yet my account if way more than double because I have been contributing a hundred bucks here and there when i can afford to contributions plus compound interest give you growth over time not one or the other so back to your what now

and sometimes amazon sell new physical releases at 50 while everyone else is at 60 I am sure it relates to buying power but you would think a company that more or less exclusively sells games would at least be able to negotiate more competitive terms than more generic retailers i get that there are agreements around the acceptable prices between retailers and publishers around how games are priced like not going below certain prices on new games but I have also tried looking further into this and i can not find any clear sources indicating how these pricing agreements between publishers and retailers actually work I would welcome any sources you could offer giving insight into the process what i do know is that gs pays far less for a used copy than they do for a new copy so how can they reasonably justify taking lower margins on a new copy over a used copy they most likely paid 5 for this particular game was on sale for 15 which i suspect is right around or more likely below what they actually paid to buy it new while the used copy was 20 maybe they had an obligation to offer the game at 15 per the publisher but this in itself would not obligate them to avoid lowering the prices on their used copies the only way i could see this happening is a distinct contractual arrangement with publishers and it seems a stretch to say publishers are primarily responsible for

structured and securitized I will try to explain without going into extreme detail on the mechanics of each type of product but will go into the general idea of each of them because to understand what a bespoke tranche opportunity is you have to understand what is being bought or sold and what roles everyone play in the process a mortgage loan is made to someone who is interested in buying a home that does not have all the cash to buy it outright loans are typically longterm 1030yrs with a fixed interest rate consisting of monthly payments to be made during the life of the loan the first few years of payments largely go towards paying the interest while very little go towards paying off loan if you have a monthly payment of 2000 a month 1400 of that would go towards paying interest while only 600 would go towards equity or the actual amount you owe on the loan the interest collected up front is important in order for these loans to be sold on the secondary market a mbs or mortage backed security is a packaged pool of individual loans made to mainstreet these were typically created by investment banks who purchase large pools of loans made by smaller banks or mortgage brokers who find people to loan money to smaller banks such as washington mutual wachovia and mortgage lenders like countrywide funded loans in which they were sold to and bought by institutions largest of them fannie mae and freddie mac who only buy wholesale cdo or collateralized debt obligation generally speaking consists of slices of varying mbsabs portfolios then split again and sold as credit linked notes of varying tiers tranche of quality and risks and yields there are many different types of cdos the basic and typical vanilla plain cdo is a cashflow cdo where the interest payments on loans flow into that 1400 of interest a month goes this direction there are cdo squared which are created from varying tranches of other cdos there are synthetic cdos and hybrid cdos consists of cash flow payments from credit default swaps there are different motivations for investors and banks for the creation of these types of products an investor can not just say let us go short mortgages and short sell mbs or cdos instead in order to short the mortgage market one must buy insurance or credit protection in the form of cds this allows for the buyer to protect or go short while the other side of the transaction allows for an investor to go long or gain exposure to replicate the performance to securities that are no longer for sale a cds or credit default swap is itself a type of insurance but was widely not used in that fashion it is siimilar to a put option in which the buyer must pay the seller a premium but that is where the similarity ends the understanding is that the seller will collect monthly cash payments for the term of the agreement and in case of a credit event default of the underlying security the seller of cds is to make the buyer whole unlike buying insurance for a car from a insurer such as state farm or churchill in the uk cds are more than often done with zero transparency and accountability since there are not really any laws to govern such agreements writing or selling cds protection generates cash flow and in the beginning was very lucrative to sell protection many banks and even insurance companies would sell protection to investors who did not even own the underlying security that they wanted protection against eventually the quality of loans being made deteriorated and enough loans were defaulting to where credit events were triggered and requiring sellers of cds to make whole on these agreements with cash the great thing about selling cds was that the seller was not required to keep any capital in reserve in case they needed to payout on any protection they sold the use of cds quickly became a way to pass on risk to another investor or counterparty the ability to transfer risk in this manner created a entirely new market for institutions to create deals that were rated to be so safe giving the illusion of there not being any risk the more complicated types of securitized products eventually are created and custom tailored or bespoke to take a position with a investor a ibmarket maker such as goldman sachs is known for being able to create bespoke products if a client wants to buy credit protection cds from gs gs would then find a way to offset or hedge their risk to someone else by creating something like a synthetic cdo but since they do not want to hold all the risk or have it being held on their own balance sheet they try to find subscribers other investors yo fund it by selling cln or credit linked notes a bespoke tranche opportunity is side of a very high leveraged unfunded senior super senior tranche of a cdo linked to a bespoke portfolio that involves the use of a derivative such as a credit default swap from a single counterparty any derivative is synthetic and is an vehicle created to replicate the performance of something without actually owning the asset it is replicating a derivative is also leveraged and provides credit enhancement in the case of structured finance it is also important to remember that there are at least two sides to every trade and when it comes to some of these bespoke cdos the amount of investors involved are usually 23 making it very illiquid they are oneoff bespoke suits custom tailored towards a client s specific needs the derivatives market became so large that the value of all the cds if all hit credit events would roughly equal to 600 trillion dollars in cash needed to make good on these agreements to put into perspective the total value of equities in all 58 major stock exchanges worldwide was worth a total of 62 trillion while the value of the fixed income market bonds etc was around 93 trillion only a black swan type of event would because these agreements to bust housing values started to flatten and started to decline while the stock market making all time highs defaults were triggering some cds but financial markets were strong and stable money was cheap to borrow that is until greenspan and the fed lit a match and threw it into the fire by reverserepos which are used to suck up cash from the banking system this created a global margin call for all investors leading towards the selloffs in equity markets cds triggering further draining the system creating the black swan event in 2008 which was really the largest run for cash in history edit further elaboration of the role of synthetic

not have proof the 10k is evidence gt i pointed out that you do not have that evidence the 10k is evidence it is just not proof gt there is nothing to reject lol i could say they made 500 returns last year but the only evidence i have is a piece of paper i wrote it on if you showed me you had 90 days of 100 million in revenue in a market that was down 37 I would conclude you beat the market gt i feel like i answered this it depends on the institution the team and that team s goals it depends is not a very clear answer my conclusion that they are beating the market makes more sense gt hedging teams do not try to beat the market for example they try to mitigate risk that is why they are paid their salaries are pittance compared to the billions of dollars they can protect with proper hedges but when i show you the 2008 10k of gs that shows so many days of 100 million in trade revenue in a market that was down 37 that year that is not hedging revenue gt you can have 9 up days where you make 10 and one down day where you make 100000 yeah and we all know that is exactly how banks allocate risk right sometimes i wonder what kind of trader says something like this gt it is possible that gs beat the market during this time period although these numbers do not necessarily show that again evidence not proof but the more the evidence mounts the more compelling the narrative that is how this works gt but like i said a million times before and i will repeat for the million and first time i do believe that some intuitions can do better than the market there is your escape hatch again technical analysis is a bunch of bullshit and me and my friends laugh at anyone who mentions otherwise but yeah sometimes it works and people make a lot of money using it the fuck gt it is not just convenient it is quite literally basic statistics and was one of the very very first things we covered in experimental design classes the idea that if you take enough people and give them some treatment or have them do xyz type of thing some of them will be successful or get better because with a large enough number people are randomly successful the opposite would be astonishing to see for example if no one who was using ta ever made money then that would be very shocking it would not be shocking to show that technical analysis proved no better than blind guessing but we have shown that it is better than blind guessing and your own escape hatch allows for it to be successful gt this is super simple mathematics the argument you are making is akin to those who say smoking does not because cancer because my mom smoked and did not get cancer no it is not not even close gt i could not find them they are right there on the site i can not grab your hand and make you click the mouse and i said before the guy is not a fraud or fake if you want to believe he is then that is up to you but you are having to bend over backwards to accommodate all the technical analysis going on that does in fact work but you need to be able to laugh at the same time assuming everyone wants to work at a hedge fund and put on weight and lose any resemblance of a worklife balance sort of puts us on

that produced trades to be executed not the team that executed them so i guess yes amp x200b gt all i can provide is the 10k because that is all we get i do not get insider information and if i had it i sure as shit would not be posting it online you rejected the 10k and have your own hypothesis that they actually do not beat the market basically what you are saying is you do not have evidence that they beat the market i pointed out that you do not have that evidence there is nothing to reject lol i could say they made 500 returns last year but the only evidence i have is a piece of paper i wrote it on amp x200b gt so then i returned the question to you as to what they are doing getting paid and receiving bonuses for generating less revenue than what indices provide i feel like i answered this it depends on the institution the team and that team s goals hedging teams do not try to beat the market for example they try to mitigate risk that is why they are paid their salaries are pittance compared to the billions of dollars they can protect with proper hedges amp x200b gt so if we look at a year where there is a shit market and the market was down but the 10k shows they still had more profitable days than not you would still reject it jesus christ dude lol of course because that does not mean they beat the market you can have 9 up days where you make 10 and one down day where you make 100000 amp x200b gt 162 days of revenue positive trading 90 days where revenue from trading exceeded 100 million the s amp p 500 was 37 during 2008 it is possible that gs beat the market during this time period although these numbers do not necessarily show that we do not know what their return was but like i said a million times before and i will repeat for the million and first time i do believe that some intuitions can do better than the market amp x200b gt this is very convenient for you to explain away anyone who uses technical analysis to trade well you can say it is shit and worthless but at the same time acknowledge that some people use it and do very well consistently beating the market do not you think that weakens your argument or makes it a little too convenient it is not just convenient it is quite literally basic statistics and was one of the very very first things we covered in experimental design classes the idea that if you take enough people and give them some treatment or have them do xyz type of thing some of them will be successful or get better because with a large enough number people are randomly successful the opposite would be astonishing to see for example if no one who was using ta ever made money then that would be very shocking this is super simple mathematics the argument you are making is akin to those who say smoking does not because cancer because my mom smoked and did not get cancer amp x200b gt go to the site and you can see the audited statements and he does use technical analysis it is a small world and a lot of people know that guy he is legit i could not find them but saying he is legit does not make it so using other methods and then disguising it as technical analysis would not be that hard"],

read this thread for long enough and i think this is the perfect spot to add something productive to the conversation first of all let us clear up climate change climate change is a scientific term referring to changes in the world climate including global warming global warming is the progressing rise in global temperatures that we have observed consistently since the start of the industrial revolution and the problem has only gotten exponentially worse in the last few years as a matter of fact the past 3 years have been the hottest since human records of world temperatures began and by the looks of it the issue is not going to go away is it humancaused yes it is what is causing it factory farming of pork beef and poultry along with burning fossil fuels and forests for energy fuel and materials this is just how the world works at the moment and it is really bad for the global ecosystem must we forego some comfort for the sake of curtailing environmental collapse yes yes we do but there are painless ways to do that you wanted solutions and a discussion on alternatives to fossil fuels here we go petroleum products are currently mostly used for fuel in fact 74 according to the yous energy information administration to be exact 46 is used for motor gasoline 20 is used for diesel and heating oil and 8 is used in jet fuel kerosene specifically the rest is used in producing chemicals and plastics how to stop using motor gasoline switch to electric cars literally every reputable car manufacturer is working on an electric vehicle of some sort with many already planning fullelectric or hybrid lineups in the near future the cost of lithium battery cells thanks to companies like tesla is going down and new types of battery cells are in development with an even better pkg ratio than the ones we have multiple startups and major corporations like panasonic are dumping millions of usd into r amp d to make battery cells more environmentally friendly and affordable but electric cars are expensive no they are not if you have the right incentives in place china is sponsoring ev development with tax credits and the cheapest ev there sold by great wall motors called ora r1 is available for 8680 and has a maximum range of 194 miles but electric cars use electricity powered by nonrenewable sources welcome to nuclear hydroelectric and solar solar in china not even the most optimal climate zone for solar plants btw has already dropped below that of gas and is on track to dip below that of coal in 2026 this is not due to just subsidiessolar benefits heavily from economies of scale thanks to modular production of panels something that conventional power plants can not boast about moreover as an american consumer you can order a tesla solar product in under 30 seconds with apple pay so convenience for consumerside solar is no longer a factor in switching to renewable energy which saves money and benefits the environment nuclear has historically always been the most efficient and least environmentallyimpactful method of energy production with gen 4 reactors are the safest way to produce electricity on earth hydreoelectric is a very popular source of electricity as well feel free to use a cool new thing i found called bing to find price information on the two vs coal gas and oil and the results will shock you how to stop using diesel and oilbased heating products switch to electric trucks see tesla rivian mercedesbenz volvo and use geothermal like iceland how to stop using oil in jetfuel see biofuel jetfuel which replaces oil with natural products and according to nasa can reduce air traffic emissions by 5070 dozens of airlines recently did pilot flights with biofuel and the results were astounding plastics are also a fucking generative disease on the earth s ecosystem they kill animals at an astonishing rate wreck havoc on waterways which induces flooding at aquatic chokepoints and use a lot of fuel to manufacture enter bioplastics read yourself they are not an endall beallnot all are biodegradable and cost of manufacturing tends to be more expensivebut it is a step in the right direction where we need to invest our time attention and r amp d capital oh what about beef well it turns out that by feeding cows a seaweedinfused diet we can reduce their methane emissions by 99 since we are on rwallstreetbets see bynd for an excellent alternative to natural beef that tastes and good and does not destroy the ozone layer in my local area cow farms stopped factory farming and actually graze cows correctly which produces bettertasting meat curtails carbon emissions and costs more to curb consumption eating as much fucking beef as we are right now is not good for our diet anyway and red meats in excess are carcinogenic in nature and you know what is crazy doing even some of these things not to mention developing a sensible rail network as an alternative to flying where applicable incentivizing carbon extraction startups like carbon engineering and mandating restaurants and manufacturers stop using so much goddamn plastic will curtail emissions by a tremendous margin and help avert the looming climate catastrophe by another few years another crazy coincidence literally every single one of these points matches the desired goals of the green new deal democrats did a horrible job at

never make a profit eventually they will have to throw in the towel because of how much they are bleeding on a daily basis in borrow fees in the meantime i think there is huge scope for positive newsflow over the next 12 months that can because a pop in the stock price announcing additional trials with qsrs quickservice restaurants existing trials going into full partnerships eg tim hortons and once again mgmt s conservative 140 yoy increase in 2019 revenue only includes posttrial partnerships ie tim hortons would be upside entering new markets eg asia which on the conference call mgmt said they want to aggressively enter expanding their footprint in europe where rival impossible food is struggling to access because of their gmo product which the eu is very anal about and so on and of course the mother of all announcements a trial with mcdonalds i still expect this to happen in the nearterm summary i still think the stock has room to run over the next few months I am personally waiting for the above catalysts to happen new qsr trials mcdonalds announcement shortsqueeze before thinking of trimming exiting i plan to exit starting in october either way because at the end of october is when the ipo 180day lockup ends lots of insider selling from vcs and other early investors who want to monetise their investment additional supply of shares makes it easier to short

manager david tepper plans to turn appaloosa lp into a family office managing his personal wealth as he spends more time focused on running the carolina panthers his professional football team said people familiar with the matter executives at the 13 billion hedge fund have discussed several scenarios for when they could return outside clients money some of the people said including over several years or around the end of this year one of these people said a period of several years was more likely mr tepper s money makes up more than 70 of the firm s assets under management a spokesman for appaloosa said the firm has not set an exact time table for the return of all outside money appaloosa is among a small number of hedge funds that has regularly returned some investor money over the last decade in an effort to manage their size and returns employees have been told mr tepper s investment business is changing said people familiar with the matter and some have been interviewing with other investment firms some employees have been told they are welcome to stay and make investments for the family office the expected change would mark the next chapter for one of wall street s most widely respected investorsthe son of an accountant who grew up in a middleclass pittsburgh neighborhood mr tepper founded appaloosa in 1993 after repeatedly being passed over for partnership at goldman sachs group inc appaloosa s performance though volatile catapulted mr tepper to a rarified level of wealth and prominence he is known for his big bets and blunt delivery he earned billions during the depths of the financial crisis buying shares in beatendown banks while others headed for the exits he has notched annualized returns of more than 25 on average since appaloosa s start said a person familiar with the firm he has used his wealth to push for the passage of gay marriage in new york buy into professional sports teams and support education and food banks around the country even as a raft of prominent managers have called it quits in recent years citing markets that do not make sense and too much competition appaloosa has continued to profit mr tepper has ignored the fervor for big data and factordriven investing and continued to make calls based on fundamental analysis of companies and the economy yet he also has proven to be one of the few hedgefund managers capable of shifting strategies without sacrificing profits he began appaloosa as a distressed credit fund and over the years transformed into a macro investor making calls on the direction of the economy and an activist investor pushing for change at companies the 61yearold billionaire has made lifestyle changes in recent years he moved to florida in 2016 to the consternation of new jersey lawmakers concerned about the impact on the state s tax revenues and moved his firm s headquarters there too he has also been spending more time on the carolina panthers which he bought last year for an nfl record of about 22 billion he was previously a part owner of the pittsburgh steelers mr tepper is now focused on turning around the panthers and increasing revenues associated with it said people close to him for example by improving the stadium and striking lucrative partnerships he has also expressed interest in bringing a major league soccer team to charlotte nc where the panthers play their home games his planned change to appaloosa would add him to the list of wealthy investors who are returning client money to focus on managing their own fortunes hedgefund manager jonathon

greater than the price at which the turbo is been sold what is it that i am missing secondly the leverage is calculated as the underlying s price divided by the notional turbo s price which is the price i obtain from the above calculation and the ko buffer at the beginning of the turbo s lifetime coincides in with the annual financing level so that when the strike is adjusted upwards towards

the wr450f street legal but it is essentially a dirt bike with all of the dirt bike maintenance i have a wr250r and similar to the crf250l it has 6 gears and does not require a ton of maintenance and does not require engine rebuilds I would just like something with a bit more power but without the short maintenance intervals i really like the tenere 700 on paper but if my dr650 ever dies I am probably going to replace it with a ktm 690husky 701 i think if harley wanted to have a successful adv bike they would have to brand it under another name price it in the 1015k range and make sure it is spec d appropriately as an adventurelight dual sport bike i also think the harley name has a stigma associated with it for the millennial generation that would hurt sales most everyone associates

regret it but the t7 did not have a release date anywhere had i known that yamaha had a tenere 650 available in europe i would have had one imported because that is the exact type of machine i wanted

neighborhood of the gs i do not see it doing well people who can spend gs money will buy a gs and if they can not afford that then maybe a 1290 super adventure or africa twin my guess is they will price themselves out of any sales the adv segment is dominated by japanese and european bikes and they both have great offerings is there even any room for harley regardless i think people are looking forward to learning more about this as a curiosity personally I am looking forward to kawasaki announcing a replacement for the klr and maybe suzuki replacing both the dr650 and drz400 with something

the corner what do i recommend wait and see the price action if we push past 280 and hold we may see some follow through on the second time around if 280 provides resistance multiple times by some puts and brace for a retest do not be cheap and buy options that are at least 4 weeks out to protect yourself in case the price action goes against you at first if we fall from here it will be an elevator down swift and fast if we climb up there will be a ton of chop along the way so do not expect your 50 gain to turn into 500 in an hour if there are any other charts you would like posted let

follow blindly it is what i do best personally if it were my money and my shares i would look at how much mu moves on a weekly basis if you want to sell weeklies or monthly if you want to sell monthlies i would take a year or so worth of data for weeklies 5 years for monthlies and then see just how much mu moves i would remove the outliers and go from there example let us say you get the data so 52 weeks take 4 weeks out for ers and then you see ok not considering the outliers mu moves between 5 and 3 a week and then i would set my sell price at 3 or close to that for weeklies you will probably be looking at 08 or so returns on your capital in premium for monthlies maybe closer to 253 you also get the value the shares increase from the current price to the strike price fuck it i pulled the data and done the analysis selling covered calls should be a neutralbullish strategy if you have any doubt a company is going to be aroundhealthy in the near future this is not the right play I have promised myself I will never touch mu again until i recoup my losses and when i do i will not dedicate nearly the same amount of my portfolio to it but let us see how my brain works let us assume your cost basis is 39share i do this so i can try and see how premium stacks against my share price for weeklies i want at least 1 premium divided by value of shares needed to sell the contract and monthlies at least 2 what does that look like if you have 100 shares at 39share that is 3900 of capital if i want to sell weeklies i want the contract premium to be worth at least 1 of that so 40contract weeklies looking at weekly data and mu has a number of weeks that it moves more than 3 up even outside of ers I am counting 11 for 48 sets of data this is a nontrivial amount the problem is if you sell calls over 3 above share price your premiums will stink i would write the 40 contract getting you about 60 per contract this gives you 15 on your capital and if you get assigned you will get another 100 per contract not shabby monthlies i looked at 5 years of data and i considered er months because i did not want to cut out entire months this data does not have nearly the same curve that the annual data broken down by week with plenty of 510 moves even outside of er months so here I am actually looking at what can give me decent premium and just be ok with getting assigned i would pick 41 which would net you about 110contract in premium this gives you 3 a month on your capital and if you get assigned you will get another 200 per contract if you do not get assigned the 110contract is not bad at all caveat I am sure you know this this is for anyone else reading selling covered calls limits your upside it does not matter how high mu goes above your strike on the calls you wrote you only get money to the strike price considering mu has in theory the potential for a mega run let us say trade deal gets inked and gsms pile on upgrades huge if of course mu could run up to 50 in a few weeks imagine if you sold a monthly call at 41 strike right now and you had to watch share price climb to 50 if you can live with it go for it but honestly this type of scenario is why i would sell weeklies on mu so if a run started i could get assigned and then jump back into shares or hell even calls if i hated money enough and latch on selling covered calls can not offset falling share price there are other horror stories out there including people who sold covered calls on pharma stock as it fell in value to something like a quarter of his costs basis but there are just times when you need to cut a loser and let it go instead of trying to sell calls against shares hoping to claw back what you lost if you bought mu at 60 last summer and sold weeklies or monthlies as it fell

they do not seem to really upload them from what i can tell with any sort of regular scheduling some are a week some are every 2 weeks it does not seem super specific the first one i listened to was somewhat interesting with a gentleman from their paris office talking about the euromarkets how the brexit vote today this was recorded on feb 1 might affect future m amp a and things of that sort in the eurozone it did not seem terribly enlightening and it is only about a 30 minute program it is someone giving their opinion at a very kind of broad approach the second i listened to was a woman who started working with gs 30 years ago because she has skills in writing scripts and automation of research it sounds she was brought in for risk algos and that sort of thing but a lot of it was why she wanted to work with gs and that sort which is great nothing against her but as far as really getting an expert perspective on the market I would venture to say there are better out there lastly again

did buy more shares of all my etf holdings except nasdaq 100 as for stocks i bought a few shares of bac a couple days before the er which turned out to be a great decision i bought more sq after it finally seemed a little healthier than last quarter of 18 i am very bullish on this company as i mentioned a few times in other posts i also bought some dis for me it is mostly a value play but i hope there will be some growth from disney i increased my holdings in aapl too i really like their approach in focusing on services and i believe the size of the drop in the sp was unjustified and i think the brand is still extremely strong i finally bought brkb too i also finally saw a great opportunity in buying ilmn a stock that I have been eyeing for some time right now I am considering buying more into some banking stocks i like both bac and jpm that I am holding and I am considering increasing my holdings in both I am slightly more inclined to buy bac both offer pretty solid dividends and i like both companies for multiple reasons i like the current valuations in the whole banking sector and I am considering some other choices too mostly gs I will likely increase my weight in the sector not sure about how yet but this will be among my priorities and most likely next steps I am really happy with how ba and wm are doing they are both great companies I am considering buying more of both more likely wm I have also been considering buying lly or getting more jnj but i do not think I will be getting more healthcare stocks now I am considering getting into utilities stocks I am specifically looking into nee I would like to get more growth stocks probably some saas companies but I am struggling to find ones that are reasonably valued thank you for any suggestions you have"],

constructing the following portfolio with the following positions and would greatly appreciate your insights syx 20 sales are down about 18 in the past 5 years though it has an roe of 901 great profit margins de of near 0 stellar eps growth and a peg of less than 1 it is also a dividendpaying stock and is also a midcap stock that generates most of its earnings from the yous market hence signifying that it has little exposure to the youschina trade war though i am still unsure about the size of the market that it is in and if it has greater growth potential than some of my other positions mcd 20 the numbers on this one are not as good if i were to develop a position in this stock i would be paying more than 2x growth it has an roe of less than 100 eps growth has been weak though its profit margins are impeccable and it has a de of near 0 it also has curtailed exposure to the languishing economic growth and given the fact that demand for inferior goods would rise during a recession and how it has lesser exposure to the trade war and the current turmoil in ems i believe that developing a position in this dividendpaying yet ridiculous and in some ways overvalued stock would give me some positive upside to a potential recession and a trade war msft 10 i see this stock as a means for procuring exposure to the cloud space with cloud companies i do not care for profitability nor for debt levels as i believe that for a cloud bet to be profitable the stock must have high retained earnings which msft has to be able to scale and acquire market share and when it has developed a dominance in this very competitive market the company s fcfe will become a nonissue at that point its peg is decent and it has 138 market share with market share growth of over 98 though amazon is the dominant player in this space with over 50 market share but its market share growth is only about 9 however i am looking more so for a pure cloud play rtn 10 due to the recent surge in defence spending under the current yous administration and the fact that raytheon out of all the other yous defence contractors generates the largest portion of its revenue from defence contracts roughly 94 and with a peg of 068 and above industry average roe and seeing as how tensions in the middle east and north korea are on the rise and nk still investing in its nuclear weapons program i do think that raytheon will rise dramatically eps growth in the next 5 years also seems to be impeccable with that being said the de of 045 is verging somewhat on the high side aapl 10 apple s fundamentals for the most part seem to be robust the iphone which comprises 62 of apple s sales is expected to only grow at 0 to 5 in coming years and apple deciding no longer to reveal the asp of their iphones is also worrisome languishing demand in china the largest market for iphones will also pose an issue the peg is decent and apple does pay a dividend and an roe of 487 and stellar eps growth in the past is also commendable however the de of gt 1 is quite troublesome though i think that the service business will be the most promising expected to grow at 15 in fact just this quarter apple s services brought in 92 billion beating estimates of 85 billion in addition the buybacks alone are expected to result in an increase of 4 this year in the stock price they are expected to hit 50 billion 3 the next and 5 in 2020 i also believe in the underlying philosophy of their products making devices thinner lighter and more minimalistic and hence complying by the longterm trend of portability over performance and alleviating what i believe is the sort of tech aspect of their products which is simply a source of distraction and confusion and their business model committing their operational and strategic focus towards neglected segments of the market as they had done with the iphone that have huge growth potential and not just appeasing shortterm market interest as a means of milking the profitability of a single product line i also believe that apple has tremendous potential in healthcare and autonomous vehicles which are both trillion dollar markets gldm 10 this is mainly to hedge against risk the etf also has a very low expense ratio gs 20 my only objection to this stock is the potential negative implications of the recent 1mdb scandal and the de of 708 does not help the stock has been downgraded heavily though the fundamentals for the most part are quite robust it is operating margin is stellar eps growth in the past and the peg have been terrific 029 moreover gs has also

programs and start at privateequity firms in the summer of 2020 with salaries that can exceed 300000 junior bankers in analyst programs typically make in the low six figures including bonuses it is crazy said patrick curtis who runs wall street oasis a financial careers website this timing definitely caught a lot of people by surprise recruiting used to take place during the summer once

started before christmas applicants describe a frantic period of interviews and exploding offers that can expire in 24 hours or less banks once expected to retain twothirds of each analyst class but

of the 12 trillion market according to data from fitch ratings the shift also would force fund managers to question how well they understand the risk in their investments and potentially hurt prices for other highyield debt it is a relatively systemic company said david meneret founder of hedge fund mill hill capital which has been betting against ge by using creditdefault swaps or cds since july it would be extremely concerning to have that much paper moving from investment grade to high yield bond investors say they are selling in part because ge s complex financial reporting makes it hard to analyze if more unexpected losses will be revealed triggering another sudden downgrade the company is considering breaking out financial performance of individual subsidiaries to provide greater transparency to investors a person familiar with the matter said ge management aims to recapture a singlea credit rating through divestitures and by refocusing on its power and aviation manufacturing

bonds remain widely held by insurers pensions and mutual funds many of which have ratings requirements that force them to sell bonds rated below investment grade a shortterm bond fund operated by

owned about 300 million in june but has since reduced its holdings which now make up a fraction of 1 of its investments a company spokesman said bond prices began their recent fall in late october when the company disclosed 22 billion in unexpected charges tied to its power unit after reporting a 6 billion shortfall in insurance reserves in the first quarter ge s bonds have been the most actively traded in the yous corporatedebt market over the past two weeks with more than 10 billion changing hands according to marketaxess some bondholders are purchasing creditdefault swaps which pay out if ge defaults to protect themselves while hedge funds are buying the swaps in a bet that they will rise in value as the company s fortunes worsen prices of ge cds roughly doubled in november and the dollar amount of swaps outstanding quadrupled to 836 million the highest amount of any corporate borrower in the world according to ihs markit and dtcc data wall street banks with lending commitments to ge also are buying cds to protect loans to the company according to people familiar with the trades banks account for about 10 of the recent ge cds transactions one of the people said the recent downgrades made borrowing through commercial paper more difficult for ge and the company is increasingly drawing on 41 billion of credit lines provided by more than 30 banks to fund itself according to its quarterly earnings report ge s lenders include citigroup goldman sachs group and morgan stanley according to its 2017 annual report we currently are using 2 billion of these facilities as well as the commercial paper market for general intraquarter working capital needs said ge s treasurer jennifer vanbelle the more ge borrows from the banks the more cds they will buy pushing the cost of the swaps higher and increasing the perceived risk of default mr meneret said current cds prices imply a default risk over the next five years of about 16 almost twice the approximately 9 risk implied at the end of october the sharp moves in ge debt and derivative prices reflect concerns that further losses or cash shortages may be revealed investors said there is significant potential for negative credit surprises as ge proceeds with its comprehensive review of assets said david sherman founder of cohanzick management llc which is selling short ge bonds in a

395 395k of inflated nflx no thanks so now instead of losing 900 on a 3825 nflx put i bought a week or so back i might actually make a profit or just lose 100 200 this is probably not the optimal

traders in chicago london and new york familiar with the transaction in other words the owner of the position simply took the fed at its word and bet against the shallow hike projections priced into the market to do so the trader bought a put spread option on march 2019 eurodollars partly funded by selling a call in the same expiry the 100000 contract position came all from one trade at just half a tick meaning the person paid a 125 million premium the bet was being unwound last week against a market level of around 11 ticks the traders familiar with the transaction said that markup equates to a 2000 percent return if the entire block was liquidated that would result in a 26 million profit just as the timing of getting into the trade proved prescient overnight index swaps were pricing in close to four rate hikes for the year as recently as last week so too was the decision to book profits the beginning of the unwind came ahead of wednesday s release of minutes of the fed s may meeting which revealed that policy makers were discussing a potential cut to the interest on excess reserves ioer rate that helped spur a shortend rally which would have eaten into the trade s gains in a sign of how aggressively the positions are being unwound the open interest across the three option strikes has plunged on each of the puts at 9750 and 97375 the amount of risk has dropped about 50 percent while the call at 9800 has fallen 35 percent from february s peak levels according to data compiled by bloomberg from the start the trade had the look of a sure winner the only time it was in jeopardy was during the early february volatility panic those traders who trusted the fed or even just their inhouse calls should not have thought twice about jumping into this cheap bet those who did are now

funding under the proposal remains at about 200bn this was originally described as helping to finance up to 1 trillion in infrastructure investment but the president has described it more recently as backing up to 15 trillion regardless of the amount of nonfederal funding the proposal might attract the federal portion remains 200bn spread over several years 2 the major aspects of the proposal are similar to the proposal that has been circulating informally and has already been described in the media it consists of four broad segments infrastructure incentives program 100bn states would be required to establish a sustainable nonfederal funding stream equal to 80 of project costs which would be matched with 20 federal funding this would be aimed at traditional areas of federal investment ie transportation watersewer rural infrastructure program 50bn this funding would come via grants to states with no matching funds required and would be aimed more broadly than traditional federal investment by including broadband and electrical power in addition to transportation and watersewer transformative projects program 20bn the federal government would put up funding for 30 50 or 80 of the project cost depending on project stage this would be aimed at projects that are commercially viable but have much higher than usual riskreward infrastructure financing programs 20bn the proposal would expand several existing federal programs through additional funding and broader eligibility including the tifia and wifia programs and private activity bonds pabs 3 the proposal also calls for a number of regulatory changes including permitting reforms and broader allowances for states to use tolling on interstate highways in addition the proposal would allow for greater divestiture of federal infrastructure assets 4 our view has been that infrastructure legislation will be difficult to enact this year in light of the need for 60 votes in the senate a lack of bipartisan consensus regarding the appropriate structure for federal infrastructure funds and political considerations ahead of the upcoming midterm election with few apparent changes from the document floated several weeks ago the new proposal seems unlikely to change the dim prospects for an infrastructure financing plan being enacted this year in our view"], "predictions": ["positive"], "sentiments": [0.9266],
