otherwise it would just be a value trap like reits or something there is around 55 million shares held by current schedule 13d13g holders so those are practically locked up quite a few more who dropped under 5 ownership recently who may or may not still be holding passively and then there is around 9 million shares held by insiders i took the data from fintelio verify it yourself as i might have made a mistake on adding it up total outstanding shares is only around 65 million shares that is almost all of the shares accounted for of course they are not completely locked up schedule 13g holders have to file within 10 days of any changes by 5 or more schedule 13d have to file within 2 days of any changes by 1 or more now here s the crazy part according to yahoo there are around 57 million shares short and the value is definitely still close to that because iborrowdeskcom has a 537 interest rate fee for short selling and there is only 200000 shares available interactivebrokers many of these people are already in the red as the current stock price is the highest it is every been since spring of 2019 what does this all mean you buy it because short sellers fucked up and did not exit their position when gme started doing massive share buybacks instead some idiots kept shorting gme thinking it would go to 0 but the balance sheet says otherwise that they are far from going bankrupt more cash than debt in addition there is never been a worse time to bet on gamestop s bankruptcy right at the beginning of a massive console cycle surpasses the underpowered ps4xboxone with no backwards compatibility and a massive gaming boon fueled by covid restrictions with current borrowing rates short sellers that do not cover only break even if gme goes to 0 in 2 years this is primed to trigger a short squeeze like kodk aprn tlry kbio and htz except the risk is much much lower because gme is also a reasonable longterm hold even with the current valuations keep in mind this is still a company that rakes in billions in revenue annually with only around a 600 million market cap and is well positioned to finally stop its cashburn and declining revenues to justify a higher

there is not much volatility left we know how earnings went nkla is a good one I have sold covered calls on them too nio is a great one to play as well i made 50 profit 700 selling 13 contracts on them for earnings and buying them back after iv crush killed the puts i stuck with kodk because it is the highest premiums for the cheapest stock haha", "it really depends on what you want to do monthly means higher premiums because you have more time for it to hit the strike price weekly is lower because less time if you want to keep the shares then you might consider further otm weeklies but you are going to get way less money with kodk it is not a long term hold stock lol i want to get rid of it so i sell aggressively close to my cost basis the price i bought my shares at i also sold monthlies on the last go around sold weeklies the first time with kodk I would recommend buying on the down swing then waiting for an upswing they have huge up and down movement if you wait for a spike premiums go way up sell calls on the upswing and get the larger premiums if you can for instance last monday i sold 30 contracts of 1016 750c little did i know that the stock moved after hours monday on the news that some fund also has a shit load of shares i sold my calls that monday during the day for about 35k premium at open tuesday the same calls were worth 12k while it would have been cool to have sold then i had no idea when it would randomly pop so I am not salty about it i am now back up on the calls i sold since kodk has swung back down I am just using that as an example of when you could sell a call and make more premium", "for sure bro iv means higher premiums yeah so typically a boomer stock like wmt that does not move a lot has a way lower premium tsla nkla or kodk or any other volatile meme stonk has way more iv so higher premiums a lot of things influence premiums too but that is a big one", "i did it just got lost i guess I have been posting about kodk since

super high", "no so you can write as many contracts as you have got shares 100 shares 1 contract I have got 3000 shares because I am retarded so i can write 30 contracts that is what is called a covered call your contracts are covered with the shares you hold in your account you can also sell a covered put but you would typically cover it with cash for instance i sell a 5p on kodk meaning if it hits the strike price i might get assigned tren the commentary above me is trying to sell a 5p on kodk so he gets the premium and if it goes down to 5 he gets assigned those shares and has to buy them at that price selling covered puts is a great way to buy shares on a stock you want you get to keep the premium and you get the shares you wanted anyways at a lower price assuming it hits that price", "buy to close is if you want to keep your shares a lot of people who play theta gang will buy their stuff back at a certain profit if they like the stock shares for instance say i sold 30 contracts of kodk for 70 each but i want 50 profit then i buy back when they are worth 35 each of course i have less profit but it is less risky if i want to keep the shares if i sold a monthly and was up on it a lot but at the last minute it popped up in value and i lost the shares and wanted to keep them then I would be mad i guess in my case it is kodk a trash stock I am 100 fine with losing them so i keep the contracts till expiration then do it again", "kodk i know it sounds dumb but the premiums are crazy buy some cheap ass shares and go to town bro I have got 3k shares I am just

finding great companies that are on sale another myth is that value amp growth are separate things which is not true you can have a high growth amp undervalued company in fact my main position is up 60 within the past 4 months and is exactly that a company that is undervalued but growing exponentially fast I am taking revenue growing 100 a year you can buy something without looking a fundamental research and still make a killing no one said you could not the difference is how each investor reacts to market dips and how the investor knows when to close each position discounted cash flow analysis gives you an exact follow amount at which you should sell the company you also feel 10000 more comfortable with long term investments and during any market dips because you actually understand the business and know it is a good company you stop thinking short term and reacting to every micro movement and are able to leave stocks for months without a thought this is the main reason i switched my retirement accounts to use this method if your not using fundamentals you are either using technicals or simply jumping on bandwagons without any other reason if your using technicals look at creating an algorithm that you can backtest this will give you the same security as discounted cash flow analysis because the program will enter and exit for you and you can easily see the historic performance of the strategy lastly if your just jumping on the bandwagon stocks you are simply making money from someone stupider than you your basically betting that someone dumber than you will buy at a higher price the only danger here is these hypes can die out quickly and you do not want to be stuck holding these take kodk as a perfect example some idiots no doubt bought at the top and are now down 80 in a month lol if the last one is your style head over to wsb and go big or go home you can make a mind blowing amount or you can loose it all most people lose everything but if you really have skill the more expectations a stock had in the future the higher the stock price and the more whacked out the fundamentals become in comparison take tsla for example people are expecting musk to change the world and they are pricing that in of course fundamentals will say it is overvalued when expectations are insanely high but the catch is the higher expectation stocks are more volatile in nature one small hiccup with musk the stock will drop significantly", "yes kodk feed my puts", "dear theta gang i know you are there got 1200 bp you have a play for me to sell ccs

will moon on another short squeeze you could just set a limit sell order to sell at 100200 gains or just lose the premium I am personally net short on weeklies because i think it will bleed until news comes out and the sec is not going to move particularly quickly imo navarro said it was the dumbest thing ever because it seems like a pretty clear instance of insider trading at least that is the way i read it seems to be how the market is interpreting it too and trump wants to win the election in nov the last thing he needs is for dems to be able to say he gave kodak a loan after insider trading he does not need them to manufacture drugs or wahtever as much as he needs to not give dems a strong talking point also i think the short float is 47 so yes it will definitely have bigly swings but will ultimately keep spiking and then dumping without good news from dpump or sec and who knows what was going on in the price action big calls are usually signs of hedging and with a huge short float hedging makes sense rather than more insider trading which they are already currently under tons of heat for i do agree if you get a good short spike fd calls could print if you monitor the stock

strongly wh advisor navarro basically called them retards he did not say the deal is off based on what I am seeing what happened at kodak was probably the dumbest decisions made by executives in corporate history navarro said and good old bigly orange man he wants manufacturing in america do you really think he gives a fuck about insider trading or any other laws i would be surprised if he pulls support for the loan america first bithes fintel has got kodk at 25 short interest it will have swings on this death march even if does die fast price action today was weird and some pretty

or weeks following practically though this will increase the shares available to trade that are not on ice long term holders people who forgot or restricted insiders by at least 100 possibly 200 there will not be enough buyers to absorb this until the price drops significantly more today was just the frontrun of that trade the news cycle is unfavorable more headlines coming out about trump admin shenanigans and also about insiders giving themselves suspicious stock grants this will hammer the buying orgy that sent it up and spook a bunch of retail investors out and dissuade more from buying additionally they are using the loan to build a generic pharma inputs business that is a commodity business that is very sensitive to cost efficiency prices get set based on what indian and chinese firms can do and their cost of manufacturing is going to be lower than rochester the only way this can make significant profit is if the us govt is buying it at an inflated price or we put huge tariffs on those inputs even then it is a low barriers to entry commodity business so you expect low profits a barrons analyst said that generic drug firms trade at 15x sales and 1 of assets creates 40 cents of revenue that means kodk will generate 300400m in sales which would then be 450600m of market value you then add in existing business which is maybe worth a few hundred million then wipe out 100m of debt from note conversion and if you are an extreme optimist you get to 1b valuation but that is still 1113 a share after dilution and that is if they are operating as efficiently as an indian or chinese firm or get special subsidies to make it work both of which seem very unlikely to me it is a lot of ifs my view is that in this unproven situation sketchiness and vagueness of the detail and terms and the low historical performance of management and poor company governance you are looking at 5 7 a share maybe 8 at best if there is more carefully managed hype and the shortterm trading dynamics are going to be brutal as people race to the exits as new shares come in and try to take gains noteholders who converted have a 317 basis so are probably delighted to get anything
