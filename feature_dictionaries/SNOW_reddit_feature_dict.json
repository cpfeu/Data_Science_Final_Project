they have and will continue to grow their commercial services with a solutions platform that has proven effective in a diverse range of industries airlines medicine autos and more to put it another way it is unlikely that tesla would ever have products or services to palantir however it is very conceivable that palantir could be used by tesla palantir is not only ai data analytics they are also a siloed privacy based data sharing platform and from every account I have read including posts on this thread by people whi have used it the software drives critical decision making that makes it very valuable to the organizations and companies who use it to the extent that they expand their use of it and it seems that the margins on doing a few key essential things really well that are applicable to wvery business and organization is far more scalable at a lower cost than running concurrent manufacturing insurance software and energy bsuinesses per your tesla example palantir has not been particularly low key if anything they have been on the wrong side of the publicity regarding how effective their software has been this is also why i believe their role in helping manage covid tracing programs will help them gain notariety but you are right their valuation hype would need to be more akin to snow or ayx or fsly at their apexes or ttd crwd net or other b2b services rather than consumer facing brands like tsla or zm strong growth numbers will take care of that a further point to make is that large investment banks who did not invest in palantir during their nearly two decades as a private company were left out of the ipo i feel that worked against pltr s share pricing but also demonstrates that their do not need additional capital as the ibs and hedge funds begin eatablishing their positions the share price will go up there is a lot of room for this thing to grow as a business and the valuation will follow suit", "rain and snow but that is not a problem if you are goggins", "yea but tesla has countless different business segments they look to be excelling in from ev cars to battery to car insurance to energy grid and so forth and so on palantir is in ai data analytics so one main segment it has also never made a profit despite many years of existence most importantly it is lowkey and not attention grabbing like tesla and zm where everyone uses it and sees it on a daily basis all of this combined with a very high valuation already gives me doubt that it will go up too much further you have a valid point on snow but i think that snow rose because people heard warren buffet was in i do not see palantir rising to more than 1517 anytime soon unless they show profit and expand into nonfederal"], "predictions": ["neutral",

however this morning he noticed something suspicious downhill blue covered the townscape white block letters large enough to be readable something awful something foul something the grinch found to be inexplicable a sign with just the last name of the office sitting dump trump the grinch frowned and scratched his head smoke could have come out if he was not so confused not even a shred whonald trump was a thorn in the grinch s side and now he was blocking his perfectly miserable view of whoville it was not a bout of fog of rain of snow or of blinding sunlight that shielded his gaze like a veil it was a mayor or orange and hay hues who spoke out of rhyme so badly that no one could listen to him who decided to be the reason for the grinch s ail no who or what liked whonald trump most certainly not the what who lived in a dump a lightbulb went off so bright it could have blinded the grinch and then he got an idea an awful idea the grinch got a wonderful awful idea if he is more foul than trash then i suppose that is where he should end up if he wants to block my view with his signs of blue then the dump is where I will put them too i can not get rid of whonald trump but i can clean this place up and get rid of the cardboard goo so the grinch got to planning and he planned and he planned and he planned he sewed himself a cloak of black some mittens of snatching shoes of tracking and he made sure they worked he slicked back his fur of green and sprayed it down with hairspray he made sure double checked that there were no green strays he tangled up trash bags and slipped on a whocdc approved mask night will come where his plan will take action and then in the morning he will bask and night did come it came quietly and the grinch descended from wherefrom he sneaked and slithered through town silent as can be he plucked up signs left and right stuffing them in black bags until there were no more to see he disturbed not one soul not a single who that he knew of a little who watched from her window clutching a blanket in her tiny who hands not a word left her mouth she would not dare spoil his plans she saw nothing that cindy lou who as she slipped back to bed to hope the bug will not catch her in the night it took nearly a whole night but he did it every sign in whoville plucked from the earth but that was not the only bit a step further he placed pesky raccoons in the lawn of whonald trump s whoville home scattering the mayor s trash all along the green grass and leaving the animals to run free back to the mountain the grinch sneaked a bag of signs slung over his shoulder and against his back with the name of a man he would never have respected at the whoville land dump on the other side of his home the grinch tossed his stolen signs so he could go back home and sleep come morning the town was silent not a single who made a sound but it was apparent that they noticed and were trying to stay quiet when whonald trump noticed the silence was broken he yelled and whined trying to shoo raccoons from his property the minute he awoken then he noticed the clear skies and began to cry why would anyone steal my signs I am the best and I will find who did this and punish them I will hold a rally and offer to pay someone if they fess up that is what I will do the who is did not attend that afternoon rally whonald trump went around to whoville home to whoville home bothering each family like he was looking for an ally cindy lou who did not tell whonald trump that she saw the grinch steal the signs whonald trump instead came to the conclusion on his own as he whined i need to build a wall to keep the what out he stole my signs and is a threat to whoville that is when the who is decided they had enough whonald trump i think you are being too dramatic demetri dee who pointed a finger at him tired of his antics i do not think you are fit for mayor anymore I am trying to take direct action against the what I am not racist I am the least racist person in this room I am just saying that that what is a danger to our whoville and we must keep his kind out if the grinch stole your signs of blue then i think i trust the grinch more than you whonald trump did not fault but he also had no chance to speak up cindy lou who did the grinch stole the signs i watched him i think he is very brave to stand up against a man like mayor whonald trump and i think it is time we learn from him i do not think whonald trump should be mayor anymore i do not like him whonald trump tried to speak up he was drowned out by voices of angry who is i lost my health insurance because of whonald trump i think he should go live in the dump whonald trump lied to me he lied to us mary who lee the voices carried to the mountain waking the grinch from his slumber he was almost mad until he understood the distant mumbles the who is were angry the grinch smiled by nightfall whonald trump was kicked out of whoville and sent down on the road the grinch did not pay any attention to who replaced him he just hoped he did not have to see anymore signs that ll make his temper explode", "no venmo in snow country sir", "it is getting ready

others are also buying thousands of acres of land with aquifers lakes water rights water utilities and shares in water engineering and technology companies all over the world the second disturbing trend is that while the new water barons are buying up water all over the world governments are moving fast to limit citizens ability to become water selfsufficient as evidenced by the wellpublicized gary harrington s case in oregon in which the state criminalized the collection of rainwater in three ponds located on his private land by convicting him on nine counts and sentencing him for 30 days in jail let us put this criminalization in perspective billionaire t boone pickens owned more water rights than any other individuals in america with rights over enough of the ogallala aquifer to drain approximately 200000 acrefeet or 65 billion gallons of water a year but ordinary citizen gary harrington can not collect rainwater runoff on 170 acres of his private land it is a strange new

is the oil of the 21st century andrew liveris ceo of dow chemical company quoted in the economist magazine august 21 2008 in 2008 i wrote an article why big banks may be buying up your public water system in which i detailed how both mainstream and alternative media coverage on water has tended to focus on individual corporations and superinvestors seeking to control water by buying up water rights and water utilities but paradoxically the hidden story is a far more complicated one i argued that the real story of the global water sector is a convoluted one involving interlocking globalized capital wall street and global investment firms banks and other elite privateequity firms often transcending national boundaries to partner with each other with banks and hedge funds with technology corporations and insurance giants with regional publicsector pension funds and with sovereign wealth funds are moving rapidly into the water sector to buy up not only water rights and watertreatment technologies but also to privatize public water utilities and infrastructure now in 2012 we are seeing this trend of global consolidation of water by elite banks and tycoons accelerating in a jp morgan equity research document it states clearly that wall street appears well aware of the investment opportunities in water supply infrastructure wastewater treatment and demand management technologies indeed wall street is preparing to cash in on the global water grab in the coming decades for example goldman sachs has amassed more than 10 billion since 2006 for infrastructure investments which include water a 2008 new york times article mentioned goldman sachs morgan stanley credit suisse kohlberg kravis roberts and the carlyle group to have amassed an estimated an estimated 250 billion war chest must of it raised in the last two years to finance a tidal wave of infrastructure projects in the united states and overseas by water i mean that it includes water rights ie the right to tap groundwater aquifers and rivers land with bodies of water on it or under it ie lakes ponds and natural springs on the surface or groundwater underneath desalination projects waterpurification and treatment technologies eg desalination treatment chemicals and equipment irrigation and welldrilling technologies water and sanitation services and utilities water infrastructure maintenance and construction from pipes and distribution to all scales of treatment plants for residential commercial industrial and municipal uses water engineering services eg those involved in the design and construction of waterrelated facilities and retail water sector such as those involved in the production operation and sales of bottled water water vending machines bottled water subscription and delivery services water trucks and water tankers update of my 2008 article megabanks see water as a critical commodity since 2008 many giant banks and superinvestors are capturing more market share in the water sector and identifying water as a critical commodity much hotter than petroleum", "i agree with you op it is a fair question and the time to ask is now big tech is way overpriced snow ipo shows us retail investors do not care about fundamentals this market is irrational and I am worried too frankly i fear we have an oversold market poised for correction and I am guessing a democratic administration might cull investor confidence and trigger a correction you mentioned the k shaped recovery and i feel that is where the opportunity is when big tech stocks stop giving returns the retail investors will not sell they will trade they will seek those sectors that remain depressed after feb and invest there there are no simple answers here or else that next big thing would already be oversold I am looking at oilngas commodities oil transport wind and solar healthcare real estate brokers and mortgage services I am very bearish on some similar but distinct sectors reits will go down mortgage lenders will go down big oil will be flat exxon bp", "in the case of california a huge portion of it is native water supply is generated by precipitation in the sierra nevada mountains much of which comes in the form of snow in the case of southern california and especially it is agriculture much of the water used there is alotted from the colorado river which is fed primarily by the rocky mountains to your question about there being a sum total of water available water for human consumption typically runoff can usually be represented in the form of the simple water balance equation p et r where p is precipitation r is runoff and et is evapotranspiration the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration changes in available water are driven by changes to p and et et can not be understated in how important a water flux it is at the yearly timescale typically accounting for 70 of outgoing water flux the important part is that et returns water to the atmosphere reducing the amount of available water so how can there be less water if the sum total of water does not change the available water can change the rate of et increases with increased temperatures so if we predict that temperatures are going to rise then we can assume that et will increase if we also assume that precipitation does not increase at the same rate as et then we can estimate how much less precipitation will translate into runoff ie available water so in california if models predict that temperatures in the sierra nevadas are going to rise we can predict that the amount of incoming precipitation being diverted back to the atmosphere will increase if rates of precipitation fall over this time period as well likely then it is catastrophic for california s water supply if the same thing happens in the rocky mountains then there can be large decreases to volumes in the colorado river and if anyone is wondering why they do not just use groundwater it is because they have already used most of it up the central valley of california has sunk by about 20 feet since the start of the 20th century due to compression from loss of groundwater oh and los angeles has enough natural water to support about 5075000 people so that city is literally just a straw sucking in water from the owens valley and the colorado river should not they regulate groundwater extraction rates by farms yes but they do not in fact they stopped requiring farmers to report their water pumping rates in the 80s so bye bye data source I am a hydrologist writing a paper on this right now modeling et rates via ml at high resolution over the us using ensembles of future climate scenarios conclusion ca is in big trouble oregon not too bad wa not great but have more water than they need already", "there are new ones coming out each week look at snow and unity f n warren buffet and croney patrol get in on snow at 589 and it ipo s to us at

warrants was about 20 and now the share price is 50 warrants should trade 1150 below share price because that is the exercise price i mentioned before but then why is it 23 instead of 3850 because the market prices in the risk of the merger not going through the arbitrage opportunity comes in once the merger is confirmed the warrants will then catch up the price minus 1150 so then my holding will go from 9 to 3850 whereas if i held shares i would have still gone from 20 to 50 if you just buy shares of a spac and the merger does not go through the lowest the price can go is 10 and they will

weeks before july 31st is when a good deal of foreclosures should occur because that is two months from july 31s which is the longest amount of time banks can allow people to prolong rent and mortgage payments but in my opinion trump will likely order an executive order to push through yet another nationwide stimulus program around the middle of september when the market starts to get shaky if one has not been passed by then however after election day trump will have no major reason to keep the market afloat because if he does not get elected then he is only going to be in office for a couple more months and if he does get elected he will not be able to be elected again because of the 22nd amendment in addition the coronavirus spreads far easier indoors compared to outdoors because most houses and business do not have adequate ventilation to recycle air constantly throughout the buildings which means i expect the coronavirus to start to ramp up in northern cities starting in october and continue to do so until we reach fever pitch in december for an example of what i am talking about melbourne one of the few cities in australia that can get to temperature that allow for frost to occur which suffered minimal damage when the coronavirus first came to australia yet is now under martial law because of high numbers of cases in the city relative to the rest of australia melbourne s average temperature very rarely get cold enough to snow which paints an extremely foreboding picture for the us states that typically experience snow during the winter as well as many european

snow storms does not mean that you should make it do so there is a reason why they say to stay home during nasty storms also you are forgetting one important factor shared by most of tesla s competitors in the self driving space they are geofenced to only work in specific small testing areas ie a city and it is surrounding suburbs waymo may be really good in their testing areas but it does not function outside of those areas waymo is said to need maps that are accurate down to the centimeter to even be able to drive in an area does that sound like an approach that is scalable

underestimate the speed of technology s development you can not say we are 7 to 15 years away from self driving cars with any kind of certainty also the lack of uber in a lot of countries has nothing to do with technology it is laws and regulations keeping them out that said i do agree with you that self driving cars will not work in all parts of the world india is a good example of this there is literally mobs of pedestrians that share the road with vehicles there until they change their laws to make roads for only cars i do not see how even the most advance self driving car will ever work

rain odd road conditions smoke and fire etc google has the next highest amount of data with 20 million miles driven 15 billion versus 20 million 2 waymo could be a close competitor but their data will be owned by the chinese government i would not be surprised if they get banned from the us like huawei also they announced a level 4 self driving vehicle production but did not state a release date they could be years out on it tesla has a level 4 self driving car now 3 the problems they are facing are not monetary one of the reasons that tesla has split the stock is because the money it would not help his self driving vehicles come to fruition the problems are mechanical engineering software development etc if the problems faced in developing an autonomous vehicle were monetary google would have already created one 4 in an interview with elon musk and cathie wood arkk love her elon has said that soon the data will be more profitable than the vehicle itself as dying companies like ford gm who have been behind for years and refused to adapt try to stay alive they will pay royalties to use tesla s software making tesla s ai exponentially better with more data coming in these are

literally falling apart btw non functional is also incorrect it has a higher torque than a ford f150 and a huge trunk space so materials check functionality check design personal taste not liking the

here in response to black panthers open carrying and is pretty on the nose racist and that is extra rad because most of the people that hate guns here are hyped on black protest organizers so maybe

reasons they have not solved the ethical issue of prioritizing passenger life vs pedestrian life when a choice must be made and I am not sure how they can answer this given that people will not be happy with either choice these cars require immense amounts of uninterrupted fast bandwidth in order to function which excludes almost everything outside of major urban areas there is still a huge amount of distrust of the technology regardless of actual demonstrable safety a large number of people will prefer to drive themselves over using an autonomous car of those who are ok with the technology of autonomous vehicles there will be many who still need think they need to own their own vs taas vendors like uber or equiv inclement weather computers are terrible at determining how to safely drive in ice and snow dust storms that obscure sensors etc most humans do not do this safely but it would be exceedingly difficult to get computers programmed to handle such difficult driving conditions even as safely as humans can this is a long way off especially if said inclement weather disrupts the wireless broadband needed to make the car work as heavy rain snow and dust could in certain bands wavelengths I am sure there are a lot of other hurdles I am not thinking of offhand but even when they get points 1 and 2 figured out sufficiently and solidify the technology i do not see taas being widespread outside of very large urban areas where it might replace taxis and human rideshare drivers I am not sure they have even truly figured out how to deal with other issues like properly handling unpredictable people pets and objects people push in the way and the problem of people abusing autonomous vehicles that can not defend themselves there is also the problem of filling themselves up with gas without human intervention or charging themselves the latter a problem with all electric vehicles at this time very complex technology takes a very long time to truly get reliable amp consistent in a wide variety of conditions and small things can because big problems like what does it do if it suddenly loses internet access in the middle of a freeway not much what happens during internet outages affecting an entire network all autonomous cars would have problems even functioning internet outages happen and will always happen at times so i do not see autonomous vehicles replacing humandriven cars outside of major urban areas anytime soon if ever nor do i see autonomous freight trucks semis ever happening you will never have uninterrupted very highspeed wireless data that is reliable amp uninterrupted enough along every road in rural areas especially in the mountains with lots of trees hills and valleys so people who drive outside of big cities would

it can see immediately with 100 accuracy sort of my background is not software but i know a bit about autonomous vehicles and you do not actually need to get to 100 if you are installing an autonomous system in a traditional car what is far more important is that the system has some confidence level and if that confidence level drops too low the car brings itself to a safe stop and the human is prompted to take over in adverse conditions like snow or fog the car can simply refuse switching into autonomous mode the goal is obviously full selfdriving but it is much easier to get there in increments instead of trying to get it 100 the first time that said there is a whole host of issues that come with selfdriving a big one that i am more familiar with is hardware reliability if your phone starts glitching out after dropping it one too many times that is no big deal but if your car has a faulty sensor it could kill someone in order to function safely your car needs to be able to selfdiagnose any hardware problems which is a challenge because we build very very few electronics like that currently and to be clear I am not just saying it needs to recognize when a sensor is not responding but it needs to recognize a sensor that is sending faulty data or a logical component that is performing incorrect calculations a failure to do this is what caused the 737maxs to lawn dart

trains people that 200 of their beloved movies and franchises are worth as much as a mcdonald s meal disney used to sell and resell and resell that content they used a fake vault to make it seem more scarce and families would buy it over and over at superpremium prices that is now gone just like mp3 s and long distance calling and email one people have gotten something for free you will never be

day shift trucks would already be at the plant that meant that 13 of the staff would be working on getting the product done it would take two shifts to slaughter the number of birds that would normally be done in a couple of hours the birds will die if they get too big so those birds that were not slaughtered that day may have been lost that is money down the drain what i see happening is

product the grocery stores or the readytoeat deli meats hotdogs hams frozen microwave meals facilities may not be ordering though they now have to store this product or throw it out with poultry the

my zune still works the app market was a fucking gold mine where 3rd parties did the work and apple got a super lucrative cut they were able to wave that big dick market share of phone users in front of would be app developers and basically force them to pay whatever apple said they would pay so by selling ridiculously expensive phones and basically bending over app developers they were able to hoard a ridiculous fucking cash stash but it seemed they lacked direction and innovation after steve die and at this point they seemed to transform into a more traditional retailer focusing on expanding market share by putting iphones into the hands of the late adopters ur aunts and uncles and finally the laggards ur moms and dads by adding lines of more reasonably priced phones that would work in tandem with needing a smart phone to see pics of their grandkids on facespace the market penetration was pretty textbook while simultaneously integrating vertically by seizing the means of production get fucked qcom and now i believe is where they pivot and expand very rapidly across the board apple pay for money apple tv for entertainment apple news for well news it is too early to see what will stick but now they seem to be back to their innovative roots traditionally apple has always traded as a super super low pe relative to tech but not far off an average consumer cyclical or retail good producer so as apple releases details of their new endeavors their business expands beyond phone sales and app developer extortionists and aim for global amazon level domination for example if apple traded at amazon pe it would be over 1k not saying it should and I am aware it is apples to oranges but to prove a point of how apple price range is putting its pe in a more fair range and that giant slut dragon cash stash gives apple the ability to very very aggressively pursue these new avenues of revenue stream while enjoying an income of phone sales and app distribution extortion fees personally i feel one of the most effective ways to find hidden value is to find stocks that analysts classify incorrectly i guess an example would be atvi was being compared and sympathy moving along with toy makers when in reality analysts imo had not realized the potential video game industry had and why it was different then hasbro additionally apples balance sheet seems to be as pure as the driven snow so if a recession ever does hit they should be able to weather it and scoop up some companies who over leveraged and are about to go under so imo apple is positioned

the same as remaking a moving from 1961 in 1990 let that sink in i was 8 or 9 years old in 1990 and these movies felt new and original to me even if the story was not original and 29 years ago my

falling into the same nostalgia trap production supply and distribution methods are all improved in both industries they would have really try to make a lower quality product with all of the

can say but demand and all manner of other things but at some point maybe question whether making solar panels is just not a very good business greencentric utilities nee bep although that is an mlp so k1 are imo going to be a better investment over time I have recommended people invest in nee instead of solar panel companies on here for a long time now and that is an awfully nice looking long term chart evs the same thing the automobile industry is a very difficult and in many ways unappealing industry and the reality is that it is simply not feasible for people to all be driving evs

green investment discussions often caught up too much in shiny items that people would like to own rather than things that are more boring essential also youcontraria30 mentioned short ski resorts count me in the category of someone who is very worried about climate change vail resorts ceo rob katz wrote in an oped published a few weeks after the report s release but to the folks trying to alarm people with images of melting snow here is the dirty little secret when the effects of climate change really show up no one will care about skiing at aspen and vail vail resorts has been a very good stock for a very long time and people have mentioned a short thesis at times in the last several years when you think about the necessity of water rights for a company like that in terms of a significant part of their business it is certainly going to be an issue at some point but it might be another 5 or 10 years there are companies like that though that at some point there is going to be a discussion about water rights and it is going to go to farmers and other needs over something discretionary like ski resorts one of the political risks for a company like vail resorts is the retraction of water rights which is arguably their most critical resource donna bebb author of the stanford report told me artificial snow is energy and waterintensive and getting access pits ski resorts against farms cities and conservationists during drought years when water supplies are lowest in 2012 vail resorts reported its water rights as an intangible asset valued at 183 million"],

fascinating I am not claiming to know much on the subject just basically parroting the most salient arguments made at the investor meeting you say lidar works better than camera systems in snow and fog and that the other option would be to use radiowaves i do not doubt your expertise on the matter here would be my followup questions 1 are there frequencies that would work better than visible light that have a shorter wavelength than radio waves ir uv etc this seems to be the crux of elon s point that if radarlike capabilities are needed and i understand the nomenclature here that radar implies radiowaves but i mean the term more generally there are better frequencies to use than those used by lidar 2 do you think it is a reasonable assessment that lidar may not even be needed with a sufficiently developed neuralnetwork the point made at the investor meeting is that if a human being can drive through snowfog using only visual data to influence their actions a neural network can be trained to do the same thing given enough unique situations for the network to learn from", "gt if you are in low visibility situations fog snow etc lidar works in conditions with snow and fog and it does that better than camera systems i was part of a university design team that built a selfdriving car and we tested it in snow here are some links for you I am linking work done by other universities since i do not want to be doxxed by posting the work done by my uni gt you do want to use a radarlike system radars are very bad the wavelength for radio waves is at best lt 2 meters this means their resolving power is 1 meter this can work for detecting a full sized human but a baby can quite literally fly under the radar lidar has much better accuracy in the order a centimeter over hundreds of meters of range", "my old apartment complex thought it was acceptable to clear snow from the sidewalks using a leafblower feet from my window at 445am i legitimately woke in a fright and

zero sense if you are in low visibility situations fog snow etc and you do want to use a radarlike system it makes far more sense to use a spectrum outside of visible light elon literally quoted the

who paid him winwinloose situation to dump toxic c amp d construction amp demolition material found to contain abundant lead mercury radon and an abundance of other carcinogens and toxins there were bump truck coing and going up his mile long driveway for a year when all was said and done he could finally build his 5000sqft garage and 3500sqft pool house and halfolympic sized pool he fucked up when he flushed the pool for the winter down a drainage ditch which tunneled through the toxic debris and into the nyc reservoir his land stood directly above well the dep noticed the 40ft plume of bluishgreen water probably from the chlorine reacting with the abundamt copper piping and steel rebar in the fill clearly flowing down his hill i mean a causeway ran across the water 100yds away how stupid can you be he was quickly found out the guy who did the actual dumping got 45 days in jail and a few mil in fines my neighbor was ordered to pay 450000 demolish his garage and pool house and pool and remove all 100000cuft of fill in a highly contained manner and pay for an approved dump site well he did not he never even paid the 450000 to the state yet he is purchased race horses for his stables llamas idk why for shits and gigs and plenty of cars to fill the garage he transferred all his assets into his daughter s and grandson s name and transferred the property to his incorporated company the state knows there would spend more fighting in court trying to get him to pay up than they could get and the reservoir is an auxiliary one that only supplies water to 20000 residents of poor neighborhoods in yonkers so they do not care however since he refused to comply with the court order to clean up the debris it has since soaked down into the neighborhood water table effecting about 45 homes I would say I have needed to install a very expensive whole house double osmosis filtration system after my water tested unpotable i can not sue him because i would have needed to glom onto the original trial but at the time the notice we recieved pinned to our door just said your neighbor at 123 xyz st is being charged with operating an illegal dumping ground if you feel this effects you call did not realize it did effect us until years later when i found the court transcript online and learned the full extent so i called the dep on him i had officers sent to his house i informed the state of the ground water situation and his noncompliance i just kept sending the dep and dec once up there because fck him and i hoped they might take him back to court to compel him to clean it up anyway he obviously did not like this so now he has is gardener starting at 7am every weekday morning and 9am on weekends can not call it a noise complaint because it is within hours to walk back and forth as close to out property line 15ft from my bedroom window with a giant pushing leafblower at full blast he does it all spring summer fall and winter when there is no snow so much

performed this sort of test is clearly biased in favor of autonomous solutions which map and require the prior mapping of all routes on which the vehicle will be driven these solutions quickly provide high fidelity autonomous capabilities for mapped regions but are impractically slow to roll out on a larger scale case in point gm s self driving tech which ranked near the top in navigant s technical assessment currently functions on less than one percent of public us roads the pace of mapping will only increase at the rate at which gm deploys vehicles to map roads and they are unable to map private roads for obvious reasons also does not work in rain snow fog or other reduced visibility conditions in construction zones etc this like other autonomous driving programs ranked highly by navigant is a special case autonomous driving solution compared to tesla s general case solution this is also why tesla does not publish disengagement data gm probably experiences fewer disengagements the 01 of the time it works tesla probably experiences more disengagements but navigant does not take into account the fact that it actually works and is available far more generally the crux of the

warmer than now and thus impossible to get year round ice in the kinds of places that now have year round ice we know for sure that the earth transitioned several times from those conditions to conditions in which both poles had year round ice so how did that happen the because of the last ice age is not fully understood yet but if you look at the timeframe 25 million years ago the continents were pretty close to where they are now that is also not enough time for mountains to build and erode if you go back 200 million years ago there was a single continent and the south pole was in south africa but that is too far in the past for the recent glacial period there are a number of cycles with the earth s orbit that affect the tilt of the axis our distance from the sun etc and these oscillate over different time periods if they all line up right the effects could be cumulative ocean currents are also a factor and are the main way heat is transferred from the equator to the poles they are affected by the location of the continents salinity etc if they slow down they can because the poles to cool down this was the because of the little ice age in europe a few hundred years ago and then there is greenhouse gas levels and aerosols in the atmosphere both can be affected by volcanoes sulphur dioxide can block some of the sun s light from reaching the earth s surface and because cooling tambora was a volcano that erupted in the early 1800s in indonesia and caused the year without a summer in north america and then there is just weather patterns all you need for a glacier to form is more snow to fall in winter than melts in the summer this could be caused by increased precipitation rather than temperature differences gt it is certainly evidence based that ice at the poles causes the whole planet to be cooler which in turn makes the ice at the poles possible and also makes glaciers elsewhere possible yes this is called albedo and refers to ice and snow being more reflective than the surface below it is a positive feedback loop that works in both ways gt it is pretty solid science that the trivial differences caused by solar output cycles and longer term orbital cycles do not add up to anything in the ballpark of strong enough to kick the earth from its normal warm stability to its current cold stability so if you examine what we know about warm stable earth it is clear that year round ice could exist only on mountain tops near the poles if you remember the fact that the nearly impossible transition from warm stable to cold stable happened a few times in the last billion years there is no explanation available other than ice starting on polar mountain tops and expanding into a polar ice cap which caused enough global cooling to put a floating ice cap on the other pole i think i addressed this above gt by continental glaciers i assume you mean the smaller faster tens of thousands of years switch between minimal glaciation as now and massive glaciation all the while having the same ice cap at the south pole my point was that oscillation is less well explained it has also happened a few times during the existence of the current south pole ice cap continental glaciers are the large continentsized glaciers you see in antarctica and greenland and that existed during the last glaciation the period we are in now is called an interglacial the glaciers are melting we are actually still in an ice age it will end when all glaciers on earth have melted more often than not in earth s history there have been no glaciers and yes

was looking soft at least relative to analyst consensus for all the pumpers i think the fall wasis due to overall negative sentiment in canada around oil and gas i think the kml pipeline facing delays exacerbated it and we have been in a downspiral ever since there has been zero good news since then outside of lng canada which mind bogglingly did not move any of the stocks additionally there is been bad weather in alberta unlike the southern us canada s q2 is their weakest for the pumpers because all the snow melts and makes it impossible to drill because everything is essentially a muddy bog they call this spring breakup unfortunately the weather has included a ton of snow causing similar conditions some colloquially call it a fall breakup which has softened capex in q3 and that will leak into q4 as the weather is continuing i do not see any long term reasons we would see a significant downturn in pressure pumping canada is relatively transitory right now and once pipeline capacity starts to come online spreads should close and capex should pickup I have read in the us we are starting to see a bit less intensity on the fracking side but nothing concerning i do not understand how the analyst does not see any near term catalysts positive capex budgets from e amp p companies would be a near term catalyst tcw is the only stock that should be getting hammered since they are a canadian pure play even the selling there is overdone i think step has been hit harder than the other two because of it is small float and it can not catch a bid right now I am waiting for

stock market but a good use of that 370 is to invest in yourself so that you can get a good parttime job while still in school based on the fact that you mentioned a ss number I will assume you are in the us let me teach you about the wonders of a roth ira I am leaving out some of the finer points which I would be happy to explain later a roth ira is a retirement account that allows your investments to grow taxfree normally you earn 100 and then pay 20 taxes to the us government if you invest the leftover 80 for 50 years so you would be 63 which is roughly retirement age and make a nominal 9 return per year you would have 5949 in this case nominal means not accounting for inflation you made 5869 in profit so the us government will demand 880 in taxes that sucks a roth ira let us you legally not have to pay that 880 in taxes here are some more important points about a roth ira you can only put money into a roth ira if you have earned income earned income is when you get paid for working a job so if you want to use a roth ira you need a job saving lunch money does not count as earned income you can not put more into your roth ira than you earn and also you can not put in more than 5500 per year so if you earn 2000 the max you could contribute is 2000 but if you earn 20000 the max you could contribute is 5500 you can take out your initial investment whenever you want but there are limits on taking out your profits generally it is best to wait until you are 595 years old to take out any money so back to your 370 i would recommend you use this to invest in starting a small business or getting a relatively wellpaying job do you like sports if so look into becoming an officialumpireref you usually have to buy some equipment up front but the pay is much better than minimum wage another option as younordinarylove suggested is buying a mower to mow yards similar options would be raking yards or shoveling snow most importantly getting a job will teach you a good work ethic i worked from the day i turned 14 and I am very glad that i did investing definitely has it is place in life but working will be the primary way your build wealth edit as someone who has

relevant to this lawsuit if you have ever been in any infrastructure build pre 1985 you know all of the main infrastructure of north america you have been inhaling trace amounts of asbestos there are a million other ways to get additional significant exposure as well and talcum powder is not really on that list hell the snow in the snow scene in the wizard of oz was made out 100 pure asbestos they

simply operates the hotels and does not own the real estate is that correct with very few exceptions yes a lot of the most wellknown hotel companies have all gone asset light since the blackstone

the big brands so there is an owner an asset manager and operator and hotel companies providing mostly sales support and branding not always of course but it is a growing trend gt what is the lease arrangement between hotel operators and the real estate owners something like a triple net lease marriott mostly signs franchise and management agreements the fees tend to be 23 of total revenues with a gop incentive fee kicker leases vary quite a bit between countries to be honest ideally they want hybrid leases with a fixed component and variable top up the building owner tends to pay for most of the fit out in those cases bar any branding and lose stuff in general gt do you have any thoughts on why the hotel operating companies have significantly outperformed the hotel reits over the past few years many of the most profitable ones are still private our gop margins are a good 1520 above market for example because we went full out on tech and efficient design we tend to get upscale rates at our hotels but the rooms are budget size and cost about as much as a midscale hotel to build operational costs are at budget level with high profit margins all rooms are totally linked to our hq in terms of tech and we have stuff like automatic checkin desks and checkin apps to keep staffing costs low do not fall into the trap of thinking luxury is where it is at pick something that has a good safety margin against downturns something with low fixed costs those companies have it easier to weather storm and tend to be in a better position to expand faster a lot of the new affordable luxury brands like ruby hotels 25hrs moxy marriott citizenm and motelone have innovative concepts with a better control over fixed costs to drive that point home we secured an asset in geneva last year and

won lower fixed costs and higher profit margins make a huge difference both in locations you can afford and being crisis resistant in the end for hotels location is absolutely key in general here are a few statistics I would look at when evaluating a hotel company hotel performance of markets they are active in companies like str provide helpful stats you can even go into more detail and focus only on 5star or budget development pipelines of major brands construction costs because they can significantly slow down development city developments that promote tourism and stays at your company s hotels stuff like airport expansions or new theme parks or corporate tax advantages for moving there macro amp micro locations of their portfolio it makes a huge difference whether your hotels are smack in the centre of town or in the outskirts those outside suffer first when demand dips while prime city centre locations tend to stay afloat basically a supply amp demand analysis just with slightly different stats than people are used to be careful with companies that expand rapidly by signing fixed leases a lot of them will go belly up when the next crisis hits also be careful with hotel companies that have a lot of resorts at locations that might get hit hard by weather lack of snow hurricanes etc a single year of no revenues is kinda hard to make up", "no but i saw a european

can not seem to find a hotelonly etf either but i might be able to give you some tips in regards to hotel investing since i work for a hotel pe company you have to decide how you want to be exposed to the industry as in asset heave or asset light a lot of the wellknown companies do not actually own any real estate they simply run them under management or franchise agreements if you want exposure to the real estate go with a hotel reit if you want an asset light strategy go with the main players like marriott hilton etc keep in mind some of them still own or at least lease some small of their portfolio for both management and franchise agreements they tend to get a base fee as a of total revenues and then sometimes an incentive fee based on something like gop international hotel companies expand at different rates and speeds and this is one of the things you need to analyze most of them list their pipeline on the development website but you can find that info on a ton of different sites figure out their exposure internationally aka how many hotels and where and pipeline get reports from companies like str global to figure out which markets perform well if your chosen brand has a lot of exposure there happy days if your brand is mostly in shit markets and their pipeline does not suggest growth in good ones not great hotel companies with brands that have lower fixed costs are less risky we operate boutique hotels with small rooms but luxurious public spaces for example and everything s automated so our fixed costs are relatively low we can run a 300 bedroom hotel with just 67 staff and outsourced housekeeping our profit margin tends to be somewhere above 40 because of that in short a lot has to go wrong for us to not at least breakeven if you pick a luxury hotel company profit margins will be lower hotels that can convert a lot of per sqm are great many budget operators fall into that category keep track of new brands launched by companies if you pick a company with a lot of exposure to resort destinations keep in mind that one bad season without snow or a hurricane can totally wipe out all their profit companies like jones lang lasalle cbre colliers savills christie co in europe and hvs have hotel consultants that often release free industry reports despite hospitality being a huge industry the investment industry in that field is niche i keep on running

weird go pro is when they start loaning with wild abandon beating the fractional reserve money making pinata like a rented redheaded stepchild we just went through that hopefully the banksters do not

gets repoed it depreciates another 75 gt interest rates will be climbing very soon maybe maybe not i suspect the fed will soon join the other major central banks in implementing negative interest

android is worse because they are lucky to get updates at all well what if i told you that it is not really as big of an issue since the google play store still operates just fine on past os versions

on hardware from 2000 and still receives security updates and web support to this day meanwhile apple s mac os x snow leopard came out after windows 7 could only run on hardware from 2006 and all support for it was dropped in 2013 tough luck for those who had specialty software with no easy or affordable alternatives not only do they have to buy new hardware they will need new software and spend time and money learning how to use it my point here is that apple does not care about how long their hardware lasts their goal is to sell you more new hardware every year they do not care that it takes loads of rock and oil to make and send you a new gadget so long as it means they sold more than the year before the largest portion of a products carbon footprint that can be negated is the act of building a new product even when made with recycled stuff the rest of a products footprint come from daily use but that daily use would happen on an old or new gadget so to that end i encourage people to user their tools for as long as possible no need to replace something that still works just because the new thing is marginally better that and stop blindly buying into the apple ecosystem
