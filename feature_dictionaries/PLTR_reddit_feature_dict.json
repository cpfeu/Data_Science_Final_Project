software platform used by airbus skywise that is slowly making waves in the industry the predictive analytics they offer have already saved our company massive sums and they are not even in their final form so to speak developers still working on validating and integrating all of our aircraft data and implementing the necessary monitoring systems on our entire fleet legacies especially were quite resistant to their software and have been working as was my airline for years to develop something similar but the skywise platform is just so intuitive relatively easy to implement and demonstrably effective especially as more airlines adopt and more data is collected that it will more likely than not be a game changer if it is not one already this is something our company has struggled to do for years a lot of our systems and software are homebrew and because of high turnover it turned into a sort of frankenstein s monster complicating the already insanely difficult task of bringing all of our data together and using it to manage scheduled maintenance while still anticipating and accounting for unscheduled maintenance all within the confines of a busy flight schedule and bare minimum spares and manpower investment upon adopting the foundryskywise platform within a year palantirairbusour developers solved a problem that had been stumping us for a decade i can imagine a million scenarios and systems within our industry and out where a similar platform could produce similar effects and have been long pltr since the moment i heard they were ipo ing their reputation in the industry for hiring top talent and being a well managed company further encourage me I have also witnessed firsthand several executives of larger airlines resist adoption of skywise for years and as time goes on they have all fallen like dominoes one by one palantir does something that everybody is trying to do to some degree or another and they are far and away the best at it in

gotham one of palantir s core platforms that powers a wide range of applications in areas such as law enforcement mortgage fraud detection and disaster response in this talk we will give an overview of how elasticsearch is used at palantir and demo one of the latest applications a tool that helps lawyers investigate financial wrongdoing we will then discuss how we made the switch to elasticsearch from a custom solution built on lucene and postgres the focus will be on one of our biggest challenges implementing performant finegrained access control the main proprietary portion of pltr as far as i could find is that they have developed some custom apis to streamline data processing so if you are constantly getting real time data they have put in work to make that process faster and more reliable it kind of makes sense if that is truly what makes them special that they tried to get into finance since that is one of the few industries dealing with billions of transactions a day where speed of classification is really important the fact that they have not made many inroads in that sector makes me question how much value they have outside of government agencies after looking at palantir i decided to invest in elastic instead but i do not have a lot of conviction in that pick i just viewed the fact that elastic already has more customers than palantir especially among large corporations as a roadblock for palantir gaining share among corporations obviously palantir is not only elastic search but that is really the core functionality that most companies want and since elastic is open source all of the major developers either already have or soon will develop a gui that is the equivalent of the palantir front end such as adobe sensei", "pltr", "get ready for the

barely buy a tank of gas even today especially when you really have no idea what the thing is worth otoh if you are up 25k in the last month that is real money and given that you do not know shit about this company I would cash that in for sure if you have a large gain you can play it both ways cash in 80 and hold on to the other 20 even if you have only 2k in the stock it has potential to produce huge gains think 2k going 100x or even 1000x that is some cash small potential but potential just the same another pov if you spilled 25 of your retirement account for this stock and you have

its value to determine how much investors are willing to pay for a share before issuing it to the public the institutional bankers will do presales before ipo and upon purchasing shares earlier buyers are not allowed to sell their shares until the set lockup period expires this mitigates any risk for investors buying shares on ipo day from getting fucked and ruins a company s reputation to attract investors pltr decided not to go the traditional route bypass hiring underwriters and go direct listing but established a lockup period those private investors do not sell all of their shares on ipo

2020 earnings report 1112 after hours that being said as a shareholder lockupperiod expiration is not something to worry about mainly if your cost basis is relativity close or cheaper than the ipo price if you happen to get in at a higher price then you should view the lockupperiod as an opportunity to pick up more shares that is why you should not invest everything at once if you are playing

guidance on this upcoming q with 290m in revenues up almost 50 yoy and a 62m nongaap profit from what i remember though their stock based comp projection was huge so they are most likely going to

final form so to speak developers still working on validating and integrating all of our aircraft data and implementing the necessary monitoring systems on our entire fleet legacies especially were quite resistant to their software and have been working as was my airline for years to develop something similar but the skywise platform is just so intuitive relatively easy to implement and demonstrably effective especially as more airlines adopt and more data is collected that it will more likely than not be a game changer if it is not one already i can imagine a million scenarios and systems within our industry and out where a similar platform could produce similar effects and have been long pltr since the moment i heard they were ipo ing their reputation in the industry for

range of industries so they have and will continue to grow their commercial services with a solutions platform that has proven effective in a diverse range of industries airlines medicine autos and more to put it another way it is unlikely that tesla would ever have products or services to palantir however it is very conceivable that palantir could be used by tesla palantir is not only ai data analytics they are also a siloed privacy based data sharing platform and from every account I have read including posts on this thread by people whi have used it the software drives critical decision making that makes it very valuable to the organizations and companies who use it to the extent that they expand their use of it and it seems that the margins on doing a few key essential things really well that are applicable to wvery business and organization is far more scalable at a lower cost than running concurrent manufacturing insurance software and energy bsuinesses per your tesla example palantir has not been particularly low key if anything they have been on the wrong side of the publicity regarding how effective their software has been this is also why i believe their role in helping manage covid tracing programs will help them gain notariety but you are right their valuation hype would need to be more akin to snow or ayx or fsly at their apexes or ttd crwd net or other b2b services rather than consumer facing brands like tsla or zm strong growth numbers will take care of that a further point to make is that large investment banks who did not invest in palantir during their nearly two decades as a private company were left out of the ipo i feel that worked against pltr s share pricing but also demonstrates that their do not need additional capital as the ibs

caluation relative to revenue on the 12th if it comes in at the expected level of 1b annually then a revenue multiple of 22x does not seem that ridiculous unless you see the company as a service provider rather than as a software company i believe the latter is more accurate and better represents the future growth of the company in this case a revenue multiple of 3040x would not be all that wild if people start getting hyped up about the stock like they are for snow which is at like 120x this could happen if palantir continues to gain traction with governments wanting to use it for covid tracing already has a contract with the us and in negotiations with uk and people see palantir as a key part of the covid solution we could also see such hype if earnings come in higher than expected let us say revenue comes in at 11b and further projected income is higher than previously announced a 30x revenue multiple would put the share price at 15share fully diluted 40x would be 20share and this bakes the expiration period into the price point hard to say what a share price will do if it hits the hype cycle tsla zm snow and others have valuations that do not make sense in terms of raw financials pltr has that capacity and the share price could take off if that happens my initial forecast had been 15share by the end of the year some initial hype has already brought us there yet we

covid is going to dominate the news again starting as early as next week as cases continue to go parabolic and a market that is base case is a vaccine is coming seems setup for a big fall given where valuations and speculation are the tech trade is just enormously crowded and under the surface the largest companies seem to be unable to retake their augustseptember highs and even a small selloff could derail the market imo as for this week s monstrous rally it is not inconsistent at all with what you would see in the early stages of a bear market and is actually a potential sign of an

starlink will have its own ipo and it has been said that spacex will not be publicly traded honestly the assumption that elon s companies will be the way we communicate is fallible to say the least there is a massive difference between communicating on our own stellar body and communicating between two at an instant speed the best plays for this will more than likely be space and defense players like lmt rtx lhx hon gd noc ba maxr etc even baesy and pltr could be plays like all of these companies have something to do with space and most with some sort of satellite or communicationintelligence for all we know microsoft will just buy one of these massive companies with their pocket lint and just do it themselves also discrediting amazon is an odd choice aws is the largest player in its space blue origin is just like spacex privately held but if we are including spacex we should include blue origin as well on april 30 2020 blue origin s national team which includes lockheed martin northrop grumman and draper was awarded 579 million to develop an integrated human landing system as part of nasa s artemis program to return humans to the moon taken directly from wikipedia so blue origin lmt noc and draper are the team that are actually returning us to the moon with the intent to stay there it is more than likely these players will have high priority for a similar mission on mars if the moon mission goes well so to wrap up i suppose i just abhor tesla stock not the company itself because people have been moronic about its valuation it has a higher market cap than every other car company when it creates what is essentially a miniscule amount of cars compared to the global average they barely turn a profit in fact if it were not for environmental credits they would still probably be making a loss most quarters you can not tell me that tesla has a higher market cap than walmart when they make almost no money larger than nvda ma jpm dis every aerospace amp defense company i just can not agree with that tesla has a pe of over 1100 for fucks sake what the issue is that it is just valued as way too much enterprise value for tesla is 230bln while the market cap is 410bln for an example toyotas market cap is 182bln with a enterprise value of 342bln this is not meant as a jab at you the whole tesla thing just reeks of a bubble though please consider investing in one of the other companies i mentioned my favorites for the space category are lmt lhx and hon i own shares of ba and lmt the ones I have just mentioned could end up as great plays for both growth and

because i chose to average down with lower put sells that got assigned but it is good to balance risky stocks with some more stable ones and it is best not to sell puts if a stock has broken to a new range until its supports have been tested well and it holds at that level for risky stock with potential i really like plug though it is been a beast this week best not to sell puts until it settles I am getting all my shares assigned at 15but i liked it enough to buy some march calls at least others I have liked doing in the past are czr dkng nio spacs are a good high premium with their inherent

undervalued and a potential amzn of china gt bq boqii bq is the china chewy it listed on a bad day same day as palantir and with all the negative elements all ipo on that day tanked even pltr bq is

the big boys will loose money see bq is therefore a steal 6 now did you know one of the biggest reasons why pltr did not moon as predicted becos they tried to save money by cutting out the big boys

not pltr just too diluted to make any kind of moves", "pltr wow that thing is a shit show hope you fags did not fomo too much in it", "you have gotten some lousy advice so far here are my thoughts pltr did a direct listing which has much different implications than a standard ipo one of those consequences is that shareholders can sell their shares as soon as the company goes public do some reading to find out details about the pltr listing because shares opened at 11 instead of 7 insiders are selling fast because they want to cash out at an overhyped valuation personally i would not go anywhere near this stock why would the company all of a sudden go public after 15 years in business my guess is to cash out while they can get a high valuation now i could be totally wrong this is just my point of view so what to do first it sounds like you have too much of your net worth tied up into one company this is never good yes you have lost some money but you can lose a lot more trust me I have been through this if you truly want to remain a longterm investor of this company then only hold an amount of stock that you are comfortable with then sell the rest losing money in the market sucks but there is one upside you can deduct your losses from future income up to 3000 per year so let us say you decide to sell all your stock right now and you lose 15000 for the next five years you can deduct 3000 each year from your income which means you will reduce your tax burden and essentially get some of this money back how much money you will get back depends on your personal income situation tax bracket earnings etc i recommend speaking to an accountant to figure out how to optimize tax implications good luck", "pltr", "yeesh some people going to be bleedin with pltr",
